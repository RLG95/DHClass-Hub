      <p><date>[1773. September.]</date>WE cleared the reefs of Hamaneno towards ten o'clock, and
         steered to the W.S.W. having the islands of Raietea, Tahà, and Borabora in sight. Only one
         month had elapsed since our arrival at Taheitee, and yet we found ourselves recovered from
         the effects of a long uncomfortable cruize in cold wet climates, and during the worst of
         seasons; and all those who had the strongest symptoms of the scurvy at that time, were now
         as perfectly restored to their health as the rest. The vegetables of this delightful group
         of islands had, in all likelihood, principally effected our cure, especially as we left our
         first place of refreshment, Aitepèha, in a tolerable state of convalescence, though we had
         not then tasted any fresh animal food. Our prospect for the next month to come promised a
         continuance of health, for we carried with us between two and three hundred hogs in each
         ship, besides a number of fowls and some dogs, together with a great quantity of bananas,
         which formed a kind of orchard on our poop. It is true the want of room occasioned the
         death of several hogs, and the obstinacy of the old dogs in refusing to take any
         sustenance, deprived us of the greatest number of those animals. But we soon took an
         effectual method of saving our provisions by killing all the hogs which were weakened by
         confinement, and strewing the meat with salt. By this means it was preserved, and remained
         palatable and juicy without being so unwholesome as the pickled meat we brought from
         England, which was now so penetrated with salt, that if we attempted to sweeten it in
         water, we extracted all the remaining juices. The only inconvenience which the stay among
         these isles had brought upon our seamen, was a complaint which arose from their own
         intemperance, in carrying on a free connection with common women. But this, though many of
         them were affected with it, was fortunately of so slight a nature, that it did not, in
         general take them from their duty, and yielded quickly to the gentlest remedies.</p>

      <p>Our young friend Hedeèdee, whom we had taken with us instead of the Taheitian Porèa, felt
         himself much affected with the sea-sickness, occasioned by the motion of the ship, to which
         he was not accustomed. He told us, however, as we were looking at the high peak of
         Borabòra, that he was born in that island, and was nearly related to O-Poonee, the great
         king who had conquered Tahà and Raietea. He acquainted us, at the same time, that his own
         name was properly Mahine, he having exchanged it for that of Hedeedee with a chief in Eimeo
         a custom which, as I have already observed in another place, is common in all these
         islands. His relation, king O-Poonee, was at present, according to his account, at Mowràa,
         an island which we passed in the afternoon. It consisted of a single mountain, of a conic
         form, rising into a sharp point; and from the reports of the inhabitants of Raietea, some
         of whom had frequently visited it, we had reason to conclude that its productions are
         perfectly similar to those of all the other isles in this group.</p>

      <p>Our poor friend did not recover his appetite till the next afternoon, when he feasted on
         part of a dolphin of twenty-eight pounds weight, which had been caught by one of our
         seamen. We offered to have it dressed for him immediately, but he assured us it tasted much
         better raw; and accordingly we provided him with a bowl of sea-water, in which he dipped
         the morsels as in a sauce, and eat them with great relish, alternately biting into a ball
         of maheî, or sour bread-fruit paste, instead of bread. Before he sat down to his meal,
         however, he separated a little morsel of the fish and a bit of the maheî, as an offering to
         the Eatua or Divinity, pronouncing a few words at the same time, which we understood to be
         a short prayer. He performed the same ceremony two days after, <date>[Monday 20]</date>when
         he dined on a raw piece of shark. These instances served to convince us, that his
         countrymen have certain fixed principles of religion, and that a kind of ceremonial worship
         takes place among them, which they have perhaps preserved ever since their first separation
         from their ancestors on the continent.</p>

      <p><date>[Thursday 23.]</date>We continued our course without any event worthy of notice till
         the 23d, in the morning, when a low island appeared on our larboard bow. We steered towards
         it, and about noon found it was divided into two parts; the latitude which we observed at
         that time was 19° 8' south. We soon distinguished a quantity of shrubs and tufted trees
         upon it, over which rose a prodigious number of coco-palms. By the help of our glasses we
         observed that the shore was sandy, but here and there over-run with verdure, which probably
         was occasioned by the common bindweed of these climates (convolvulus Brasiliensis). A reef
         as we apprehended, connected the two parts of the island together, which notwithstanding
         its agreeable appearance, seemed to be entirely uninhabited. Captain Cook gave it the name
         of Hervey's Isle, in honour of the present earl of Bristol. A bird which resembled a
         sand-piper in its flight, and note, had appeared about the ship, the day before we made
         this island, and might be said to have announced its proximity, but though we observed
         another of the same sort <date>[Sunday 26.]</date>on the 26th which actually settled in the
         rigging, yet we did not fall in with another island. We held a westerly course from
         Hervey's Isle, which lies in 19° 18' south latitude and 158° 54' west longitude from
         Greenwich, till <date>[1773. October.][Friday 1.]</date>the first of October when we saw
         land before us about two o'clock in the afternoon. In four hours time we came within two or
         three leagues of it, and found it of a moderate height; the hills were covered with trees,
         and offered a pleasing, though not magnificent prospect. At the south-west extremity we
         observed a small rocky islet, and to the northward a low land of greater extent. From
         thence we judged, that the isle before us was the same which Abel Janssen Tasman named
         Middleburg Isle, in 1643, and that the other to the north, was that of Amsterdam,
         discovered by the same navigator. We lay to <date>[Saturday 2.]</date>all night, and with
         day-break passed round the S. W. point of Middleburg Isle, and ranged its western coast.
         There appeared to be some low land at the bottom of the hills, which contained plantations
         of fine young bananas, whose vivid green leaves contrasted admirably with the different
         tints of various shrubberies, and with the brown colour of the coco palms, which seemed to
         be the effect of winter. The light was still so faint, that we distinguished several fires
         glimmering in the bushes, but by degrees we likewise discerned people running along the
         shore. The hills which were low, and not so high above the level of the sea as the Isle of
         Wight, were agreeably adorned with small clumps of trees scattered at some distance, and
         the intermediate ground appeared covered with herbage, like many parts of England. It was
         not long before we perceived some of the inhabitants busied in launching several canoes,
         and paddling towards us. We threw a rope into one of these canoes which ran up close to us,
         and one of the three people in her came on board, and presented a root of the intoxicating
         pepper-tree of the South Sea Islands, touched our noses with his like the New Zeelanders,
         in sign of friendship, and then sat down on the deck without speaking a word. The captain
         presented him with a nail, upon which he immediately held it over his own head, and
         pronounced fagafetai, which was probably an expression of thanksgiving. He was naked to the
         waist, but from thence to the knees he had a piece of cloth wrapped about him, which seemed
         to be manufactured much like that of Taheitee, but was covered with a brown colour, and a
         strong glue, which made it stiff, and fit to resist the wet. His stature was middle-sized,
         and his lineaments were mild and tolerably regular. His colour was much like that of the
         common Taheitians , that is, of a clear mahogany or chestnut brown; his beard was cut short
         or shaven, and his hair was black, in short frizzled curls, burnt as it were at the tips.
         He had three circular spots on each arm, about the size of a crown piece, consisting of
         several concentric circles of elevated points, which answered to the punctures of the
         Taheitians, but were not blacked; besides these, he had other black punctures on his body.
         A small cylinder was fixed through two holes in the lap of his ear, and his left hand
         wanted the little finger. He continued his silence for a considerable while, but some
         others, who ventured on board soon after him, were of a more communicative turn, and after
         having performed the ceremony of touching noses, spoke a language which was unintelligible
         to us at that time. In the mean while we arrived at the N. W. point of the island, where we
         struck soundings on a good bottom, in an open road, and let go our anchors about nine in
         the morning. We were presently surrounded by a number of canoes, each containing three or
         four people, who offered great quantities of their cloth for sale. The canoes were small,
         about fifteen feet long, very sharp built, and decked or covered at each extremity. Most of
         them had out-riggers made of poles, like the small canoes at Taheitee, but the workmanship
         of these boats was infinitely preferable, as they were joined together with an exactness
         which surprised us, and the whole surface had received an excellent polish. Their paddles
         had short broad blades, something like those of Taheitee, but more neatly wrought, and of
         better wood. They made a great deal of noise about us, every one shewing what he had to
         sell, and calling to some one of us, who happened to look towards them. Their language was
         not unpleasing, and whatever they said, was in a singing kind of tone. Many were bold
         enough to come on board, without expressing the least hesitation, and one of these seemed
         to be a chief, or a man of some quality, and was accordingly treated with a number of
         presents, which he severally laid on his head, when he received them, saying fagafetai
         every time. Our English cloth and linen he admired most, and iron wares in the next degree.
         His behaviour was very free and unconcerned; for he went down into the cabin, and
         where-ever we thought fit to conduct him. He likewise told us, upon our enquiry, that the
         island near which we lay at anchor, (the same which Tasman called Middleburg) was called
         Ea-Oowhe among his country-men; and that the other to the north (or Tasman's Amsterdam
         island) bore the name of Tonga-Tabboo. We consulted several of the natives, in order to
         have greater certainty on this point, and always received the same names in answer.</p>

      <p>After breakfast, the captains went on shore with us and the chief, who had continued on
         board all that time. A bed of coral rocks surrounded the coast, towards the landing-place;
         but many canoes occupied the deep channels between these rocks, and a great number of
         inhabitants in them as well as on the shore, shouted for joy at our approach. The canoes
         immediately came along side the boat, and the natives threw great bales of cloth into it,
         without asking for any thing in return; while many of both sexes swam about perfectly
         naked, holding up some trifles, such as rings of tortoise-shell, fish-hooks of mother of
         pearl, and the like, for sale. As soon as we could make way through the throng of canoes,
         we approached as near as possible to the shore, and were carried to it out of our boat, for
         which the natives very readily offered their backs. The people thronged about us with every
         expression of friendship, and offered a few fruits, with a variety of arms and utensils.
         The cordial reception which we met with, was such as might have been expected from a people
         well acquainted with our good intentions, and accustomed to the transitory visits of
         European ships. But these kind islanders had never seen Europeans among them, and could
         only have heard of Tasman who visited the adjacent Amsterdam island, by imperfect
         tradition. Nothing was therefore more conspicuous in their whole behaviour than an open,
         generous disposition, free from any mean distrust. This was confirmed by the appearance of
         a great number of women in the croud, covered from the waist downwards, whose looks and
         smiles welcomed us to the shore. Mr. Hodges designed this memorable interview in an elegant
         picture, which has been engraved for captain Cook's account of this voyage. The same
         candour with which I have made it a rule to commend the performances of this ingenious
         artist, whenever they are characteristic of the objects which he meant to represent,
         obliges me to mention, that this piece, in which the execution of Mr. Sherwin cannot be too
         much admired, does not convey any adequate idea of the natives of Eaoowhe or of Tonga
         Tabbo. The plates which ornamented the history of captain Cook's former voyage, have been
         justly criticised, because they exhibited to our eyes the pleasing forms of antique figures
         and draperies, instead of those Indians of which we wished to form some idea. But it is
         also greatly to be feared, that Mr. Hodges has lost the sketches and drawings which he made
         from Nature in the course of the voyage, and supplied the deficiency in this case, from his
         own elegant ideas. The connoisseur will find Greek contours and features in this picture,
         which have never existed in the South Sea. He will admire an elegant flowing robe which
         involves the whole head and body, in an island where the women very rarely cover the
         shoulders and breast; and he will be struck with awe and delight by the figure of a divine
         old man, with a long white beard, though all the people of Ea-oowhe shave themselves with
         muscle-shells.</p>

      <p>We soon left the landing place, and followed the chief, who invited us up into the country.
         The ground from the water's side rose somewhat steep for a few yards, above which it
         flattened into a beautiful green lawn, surrounded by tall trees and tufted shrubberies, and
         open only to the sea. At the bottom of it, which might be about one hundred yards from the
         landing-place, we saw a very neat well-looking house, of which the roof sloped down within
         two feet of the ground. We advanced across the delightful green, which was so smooth, that
         it put us in mind of the finest spots in England, and were entreated to sit down in the
         house, which was most elegantly laid out with mats of the best workmanship. In one corner
         of it we saw a moveable partition of wicker-work standing upright, and, from the signs of
         the natives collected, that it separated their bed-place. The roof, sloping down on all
         sides, was formed of a great number of spars and round sticks very firmly connected, and
         covered with a sort of matting made of banana leaves.</p>

      <p>We were no sooner seated in the house, surrounded by a considerable number of natives, not
         less than a hundred, than two or three of the women welcomed us with a song, which, though
         exceedingly simple, had a very pleasing effect, and was highly musical when compared to the
         Taheitian songs. They beat time to it by snapping the second finger and thumb, and holding
         the three remaining fingers upright. Their voices were very sweet and mellow, and they sung
         in parts. When they had done they were relieved by others, who sung the same tune, and at
         last they joined together in chorus. A very ingenious gentleman, who was on this voyage
         with us, has favoured me with one of the tunes which he heard in this island, which may
         serve as a specimen to the musical part of my readers.</p>

      <p>In this little specimen the music is in the minor key, (a flat third). They varied the four
         notes without ever going lower than A or higher than E; singing them rather slow, and
         sometimes ending with the chord.</p>

      <p>The kindness of the people was expressed in every look and gesture, and they freely offered
         us some coco-nuts, of which we found the liquor very palatable. We were likewise regaled
         with a most delicious perfume in this place, which the breeze wafted towards us. It was a
         considerable time before we discovered from whence it proceeded; but at last having looked
         at some shady trees at the back of the house, we perceived they were of the lemon tribe,
         and covered with beautiful branches of white flowers, which spread this fragrant smell. The
         natives soon brought us some of the fruits, which we knew to be of the kind called
         shaddocks in the West-Indies, and pomplemoses at Batavia and the adjacent East-Indian
         isles. Their shape was perfectly globular, their size almost as large as a child's head,
         and their taste extremely pleasant.</p>

      <p>On both sides of the lawn we took notice of a fence or enclosure made of reeds, diagonally
         plaited in an elegant taste. A door, which consisted of several boards, and was hung on a
         rope instead of hinges, gave admittance into a plantation on each side. We separated, in
         order to examine this beautiful country, and at every step had reason to be well pleased
         with our discoveries. The door was so contrived as to shut after us without any assistance,
         and the enclosures were over-run with climbers, and especially a bind-weed, having flowers
         of a beautiful sky-blue. The prospect now changed into an extensive garden, where we saw a
         number of tufted shaddock-trees, tall coco-palms, many bananas, and a few bread-fruit
         trees. In the midst of this spot the path led us to a dwelling-house, like that on the
         lawn, surrounded by a great variety of shrubs in blossom, whose fragrance filled the air.
         We roamed through these bushes, and collected a variety of plants which we had never met
         with in the Society Isles. The inhabitants seemed to be of a more active and industrious
         disposition than those of Taheitee, and instead of following us in great crouds wherever we
         went, left us entirely by ourselves, unless we entreated them to accompany us. In that case
         we could venture to go with our pockets open, unless we had nails in them, upon which they
         set so great a value that they could not always resist the temptation. We passed through
         more than ten adjacent plantations or gardens, separated by enclosures, communicating with
         each other by means of the doors before mentioned. In each of them we commonly met with a
         house, of which the inhabitants were absent. Their attention to separate their property
         seemed to argue a higher degree of civilization than we had expected. Their arts,
         manufactures, and music were all more cultivated, complicated, and elegant than at the
         Society Islands. But, in return, the opulence, or rather luxury, of the Taheitians seemed
         to be much greater. We saw but few hogs and fowls here, and that great support of life, the
         bread-tree, appeared to be very scarce. Yams, therefore, and other roots, together with
         bananas, are their principal articles of diet. Their cloathing too, compared to that of
         Taheitee, was less plentiful, or at least not converted into such an article of luxury as
         at that island. Lastly, their houses, though neatly constructed, and always placed in a
         fragrant shrubbery, were less roomy and convenient. We made these reflections as we
         advanced towards the landing place, where several hundred natives were assembled; and their
         appearance immediately struck us with the idea, that if they did not enjoy so great a
         profusion of the gifts of nature as the Taheitians, those gifts were perhaps distributed to
         all with greater equality. We advanced among them, and were accosted with caresses by old
         and young, by men and women. They hugged us very heartily, and frequently kissed our hands,
         laying them on the breast, with the most expressive looks of affection that can be
         imagined. The general stature of the men was equal to our middle size, from five feet three
         to five feet ten inches. The proportions of the body were very fine, and the contours of
         the limbs extremely elegant, though something more muscular than at Taheitee, which may be
         owing to a greater and more constant exertion of strength in their agriculture and œconomy.
         Their features were extremely mild and pleasing, and differed from the Taheitian faces, in
         being more oblong than round; the nose sharper, and the lips rather thinner. Their hair was
         generally black and strongly curled, and the beard shaven or rather clipt by means of a
         couple of sharp muscle shells, (mytili). The women were, in general, a few inches shorter
         than the men, but not so small as the lower class of women at Taheitee and the Society
         Isles. Their body was exquisitely proportioned down to the waist, and their hands and arms
         were to the full as delicate as those of the Taheitian women; but like them they had such
         large feet and legs as did not harmonize with the rest. Their features, though without
         regularity, were as agreeable as we had in general observed them at the Society Isles; but
         we recollected many individuals there, especially of the principal families, to which none
         of these could be compared. The complexion of both sexes here was the same, a light
         chestnut-brown, which had commonly the appearance of perfect health. That difference of
         colour and corpulence, by which we immediately distinguished the ranks at Taheitee, was not
         to be met with in this island. The chief, who had visited us on board and accompanied us to
         the shore, was in nothing different from the common people, not even in his dress; it was
         only from the obedience which was paid to this orders that we concluded his quality. The
         custom of puncturing the skin and blacking it, was in full force among the men, and their
         belly and loins were very strongly marked in configurations more compounded than those of
         the Taheitians. The tenderest parts of the body were not free from these punctures, the
         application of which, besides being very painful, must be extremely dangerous on glandulous
         extremities, and justly excited our astonishment.</p>

      <p>The women, however, were exempted from this custom of disfiguring themselves, and had only
         a few black dots on their hands. But besides these, both sexes had three spots on the arms,
         consisting of concentric circles of punctures, without any blacking, which I have mentioned
         before. The men in general went almost naked, having only a small bit of cloth round the
         loins. Some, however, wore a dress nearly resembling that of the women. This was a long
         piece of cloth made of bark, in the same manner as the Taheitee cloth, but afterwards
         painted chequer-wise, or in patterns nearly resembling our painted floor-cloths, and
         covered with a size, which turned the wet for a long while. This they wrapped round their
         waist, the men nearly about their middle, the women more immediately under the breast, and
         in both it commonly descended below the knees. Instead of the cloth they likewise
         substituted mats, extremely well wrought, in form resembling those of Taheitee, and
         sometimes, though rarely, covered even their shoulders and breasts with them. The men
         frequently wore a string round their necks, from which a mother of pearl shell hung down on
         the breast. The women often had loose necklaces, consisting of several strings of small
         shells, intermixed with seeds, teeth of fishes, and in the middle of all the round
         operculum, or cover of a shell, as large as a crown-piece. Both their ears were perforated,
         and sometimes with two holes, and a little cylinder cut out of tortoise-shell or bone, was
         stuck through both the holes. Sometimes these cylinders were only of reed, filled with a
         red solid substance, painted and lacquered with different colours in regular compartments.
         The most singular circumstance which we observed among these people was, that many of them
         wanted the little finger on one and sometimes on both hands; the differences of sex or age
         did not exempt them from this amputation; for even amongst the few children, whom we saw
         running about naked, the greater part had already suffered this loss. Only a few grown
         people, who had preserved both their little fingers, were an exception to the general rule.
         We immediately conjectured that the death of a near relation or friend might require these
         strange mutilations, in the same manner as is customary among the Hottentots, in Africa ;
         the Guaranos, in Paraguay; and the Californians; and our enquiries, though unsuccessful at
         first, afterwards confirmed the conjecture. Another singularity, which we observed to be
         very general among these people, was a round spot on each cheek-bone, which appeared to
         have been burnt or blistered. Some had it quite recent, in others it was covered with a
         scurf, and many had a very slight mark of its former existence. We could never learn how
         and for what purpose it was made; but we supposed it could only be used like the Japanese
         moxa, as a remedy against various complaints.</p>

      <p>Notwithstanding the engaging manners of the natives, we foreshaw that we should make but a
         very short stay among them, because our captains could not obtain refreshments in any
         considerable quantity; which might be owing not so much to their scarcity upon the island,
         as to the difficulty of making our goods current for such valuable articles, when they
         could obtain them in exchange for arms and utensils. They had brought indeed a few yams,
         bananas, coco-nuts, and shaddocks for sale, but they soon dropt that branch of trade. Our
         people purchased an incredible number of fish hooks made of mother of pearl, barbed with
         tortoise-shell, but in shape exactly resembling the Taheitee fish-hooks, called witte-witte
         ; some of which were near seven inches long. They likewise bought their shells, which hung
         on the breast, their necklaces, bracelets of mother of pearl, and cylindrical sticks for
         the ear. They had the neatest ornamental combs that can be imagined, consisting of a number
         of little flat sticks about five inches long, of a yellow wood like box, most firmly and
         elegantly connected together at the bottom by a tissue of the fibres of coco-nut, some of
         which were of their natural colour, and others dyed black. These fibres were likewise
         employed in making a great variety of baskets, wrought with regular compartments of two
         colours, brown and black, or sometimes all brown, and ornamented with rows of round flat
         beads, which were made by cutting pieces of shells into that shape. The taste and the
         workmanship of these baskets were elegant in the highest degree, and varied into different
         forms and patterns. Those little stools, which serve as pillows for the head, were much
         more frequent here than at Taheitee; flattish bowls, in which they place their meat, and
         spatulas with which they mix up the bread-fruit paste, were likewise in great abundance,
         and made of the club-wood (casuarina equistifeolia), which had this name from supplying all
         the islanders in the South Sea with weapons. The clubs of the people of this isle, were of
         an infinite variety of shapes, and many of them so ponderous that we could scarce manage
         them with one hand; the most common form was quadrangular, so as to make a rhomboid at the
         broad end, and gradually tapering into a round handle at the other. But many were
         spatulated, flattish, and pointed: some had long handles and a blade which resembled the
         blade of a fleam; others were crooked, knobbed, &amp;c. But by far the greatest part were
         carved all over in many chequered patterns, which seemed to have required a long space of
         time, and incredible patience, especially when we consider, that a sharp stone, or a piece
         of coral, are the only tools which the natives can employ in this kind of work. All the
         different compartments were wrought and divided with a regularity which quite surprised us,
         and the whole surface of the plain clubs was as highly polished, as if our best workmen had
         made them with the best instruments. Besides clubs, they had spears of the same wood, which
         were sometimes plain, sharp-pointed sticks, and sometimes barbed with a sting-ray's tail.
         They had likewise bows and arrows, of a peculiar construction. The bow which was six feet
         long, was about the thickness of a little finger, and when slack, formed a slight curve.
         Its convex part was channelled with a single deep groove, in which the bow string was
         lodged, and which was likewise big enough sometimes to contain the arrow made of reed, near
         six feet long, and pointed with hard wood. When the bow was to be bent, instead of drawing
         it so as to encrease the natural curvature, they drew it the contrary way, made it
         perfectly strait, and then formed the curve on the other side. The bow-string by this means
         never needed to be tense, as the arrow received sufficient moment by changing the natural
         bent of the bow; the recoil of which was never violent enough to hurt the arm. Our seamen,
         unacquainted with the nature of these weapons, broke several of them by drawing them like
         other bows. The immense quantity of arms belonging to the natives, corresponded very ill
         with the pacific disposition, which had strongly shone through their whole behaviour
         towards us, and which still manifested itself in their readiness to dispose of them. It is
         probable that they have sometimes quarrels amongst themselves, or wage war with the
         neighbouring islands, but we could by no means discover any thing from their conversation
         or signs, which might have served to throw a light on this subject. The several articles
         above enumerated, together with all their sorts of cloth, their elegant mats, which for
         workmanship and variety excelled even those of Taheitee, and a great many other trifles too
         tedious to mention, they brought to sell, and with great eagerness exchanged for small
         nails, and sometimes for beads. But in respect of the latter their taste was different from
         that of the Taheitians; for the latter always chose those that were transparent, but the
         people of Ea-oowhe would take no other than black opaque beads, with red, blue, and white
         stripes. We traded with them till dinner-time, and then re-embarked in order to return on
         board the ships; but were obliged to sit down contented with the loss of a grapnel, which
         the natives had contrived to steal almost as soon as it was let down into the water. Their
         kind looks and acclamations followed us till we returned on board, where a number of them
         traded in their canoes with the same sorts of goods which we had purchased on shore. We saw
         several persons among them afflicted with leprous complaints, in some of which the disorder
         had risen to a high degree of virulence; one man in particular had his whole back and
         shoulders covered with a large cancerous ulcer, which was perfectly livid within, and of a
         bright yellow all round the edges. A woman was likewise unfortunate enough to have all her
         face destroyed by it in the most shocking manner; there was only a hole left in the place
         of her nose; her cheeks were swelled up and continually oozing out a purulent matter; and
         her eyes seemed ready to fall out of her head, being bloody and sore. These were some of
         the most miserable objects I recollect ever to have seen; and yet they seemed to be quite
         unconcerned about their misfortunes, traded as briskly as any of the rest, and what was
         most nauseous, had provisions to sell.</p>

      <p>After dinner Dr. Sparrman remained on board with me, in order to arrange our acquisitions
         of the morning, and my father again accompanied the captains to the shore, with a view to
         collect a fresh supply. They returned about sun-set, and my father gave the following
         account of this excursion.</p>

      <p>" At the landing-place the natives welcomed us with shouts as in the morning, and the croud
         being as numerous as ever, the trade was carried on very briskly, but provisions were
         scarce, and shaddocks in particular not at all to be had, as the season was not yet
         sufficiently advanced. Mr. Hodges, myself, and one servant, left the trading place with two
         of the natives, whom we engaged to become our guides in case of necessity, and walked up
         the hill to view the interior part of the country. Our walk lay through a number of rich
         plantations or gardens, enclosed as before mentioned with fences of reeds, or with
         quick-hedges of the beautiful coral flower, (erythrina corallodendron). Beyond these we
         entered into a lane between two enclosures, and observed bananas and yams planted in rows
         on both sides, with as much order and regularity as we employ in our agriculture. This lane
         opened into a fine extensive plain, covered with rich grasses. Having crossed it, we met
         with a most delightful walk about a mile in length, formed of four rows of coco-nut trees,
         which ended in another lane between plantations of great regularity, surrounded by
         shaddocks and other trees. It led through a cultivated valley to a spot where several paths
         crossed each other or met in one. Here we saw a fine lawn covered with a delicate green
         tuf, and surrounded by large shady trees on all sides. In one corner of it there was a
         house, which was empty at present, its inhabitants being probably by the water's side. Mr.
         Hodges sat down to draw this delightful spot. We breathed the most delicious air in the
         world, fraught with odours which might have revived a dying man; the sea-breeze played with
         our hair and gently cooled us; a number of small birds twittered on all sides, and many
         amorous doves cooed harmoniously in the deepest shade of the tree under which we were
         seated. The tree was remarkable for its roots, which came out of the stem near eight feet
         above the ground, and for its pods of more than a yard long, and two or three inches broad.
         This secluded spot, so rich in the best productions of nature, where we sat solitary with
         no other human being besides our two natives, struck us with the idea of enchanted ground,
         which being the creation of our own gay fancy, is commonly adorned with all possible
         beauties at once. In fact, there could not have been a more desirable spot for a little
         place of retirement, according to the elegant imagination of Horace, if it had only been
         supplied with a crystal fountain or a little murmuring rill! But water is unfortunately the
         only blessing denied this charming little island. To the left of this spot we discovered a
         shady walk, that brought us to another grassy lawn, at the bottom of which we perceived a
         little mount with two huts upon it. A number of reeds stuck into the ground, at the
         distance of one foot asunder, encompassed this rising, and several casuarinas, with their
         slender branches and thread-like leaves, were planted before it. The natives, whom we had
         engaged to accompany us, would not approach this mount; but we advanced and looked into the
         huts, though with great difficulty, because the bottom of the roof was not above a span
         from the ground. We found a corse in one of these huts, which had been lately deposited;
         but the other was empty. Thus the casuarina or club-wood (tòa), here, as in the Society
         Islands, pointed out the repositories of the dead. Its dull brownish-green colour, and its
         long spreading branches, where the leaves are thinly scattered and hang weeping down,
         certainly become these melancholy places to the full as well as the funereal cypress. It is
         therefore probable that the same train of ideas, which consecrated the latter in one part
         of the world to shade the tombs, might fix upon the former in these regions for a similar
         purpose. The mount on which the huts were placed was formed of small pieces of coral rock,
         like gravel, accumulated without any particular order. From thence we proceeded a little
         farther, and still found the same elegant plantations and the same kind of houses in the
         middle as before. Our natives conducted us through one of them, where they entreated us to
         sit down, and procured some coco nuts, which proved extremely refreshing. At our return we
         found our boats just ready to put off, and embarked with them immediately. We had only seen
         a few of the natives on our walk, who passed unconcernedly by us towards the place were the
         captains traded; and I believe we should have been entirely left to ourselves if we had not
         engaged two of them to become our conductors. The discharge of our guns, and their effect,
         neither excited their admiration nor their fear; but they always appeared kind and
         courteous towards us. Their women were, in general, reserved, and turned with disgust from
         the immodest behaviour of ungovernable seamen, some of them however, appeared to be of easy
         virtue, and beckoned to our people with lascivious gestures." </p>

      <p>The next morning early the captain went on shore with us, and presented the chief with a
         variety of garden seeds, explaining by signs how useful they would prove to him. This was a
         yet our only mode of conversation, though we had picked up a number of words, which, by the
         help of the principles of universal grammar, and the idea of dialects, we easily perceived
         had a great affinity with the language spoken at Taheitee and the Society Isles. O-Mai and
         Mahine (or O-Hedeède), the two natives of Raietea and Borabora who embarked with us, at
         first declared that the language was totally new and unintelligible to them; however, when
         we explained to them the affinity of several words, they presently caught the peculiar
         modification of this dialect, and conversed much better with the natives than we could have
         done after a long intercourse with them. They were extremely well pleased with this
         country, but soon perceived its defects, and told us there was but scanty provision of
         bread-fruit, few hogs and fowls, and no dogs, which was really the case. In return,
         however, they liked the abundance of sugar-canes and of intoxicating pepper, of which the
         drink had been offered to captain Cook.</p>

      <p>As soon as the captains had delivered their present, they returned to the ships, and the
         chief came on board with us. Our anchor was weighed, our sails were spread to the wind, and
         we forsook this happy island when he had scarce discovered its beauties. The chief, after
         selling a number of fish-hooks for nails and beads, hailed one of the canoes which were
         passing by, and left us with looks which spoke his friendly, open disposition.</p>

      <p>We now sailed along the western shore of Tasman's Amsterdam island, which the natives
         called Tonga-Tabboo and found it a very low flat land, compared with that which we had
         left. The middle of this island is nearly in 21° 11'S. latitude, and 175° W. longitude. Its
         highest elevation above the level of the sea, appeared to the eye never to exceed six or
         seven yards perpendicular. On the other hand, its extent was much more considerable than
         that of Ea-oowhe, and by the help of our spying-glasses, we discovered the same regular
         plantations which we had so much admired there, and saw the shores crouded with
         inhabitants, who gazed at us, probably with as much attention as we bestowed upon them.
         When we were about half way between both islands, or nearly three leagues from each, we
         were met by several canoes full of men, who attempted to come along-side, but as we
         happened to be too far to windward, they could only fetch the Adventure, where they came on
         board.</p>

      <p>In the afternoon we approached the northernmost end of the island, and perceived some small
         isles connected by reefs to the eastward. Their situation and that of the shoal to the
         north-west, where the sea broke with great violence, convinced us that we were now arrived
         at the very place where Tasman ancored in 1643, and which he called Van Diemen's Road. Here
         we dropped an anchor upon a rocky bank, and were immediately surrounded with numbers of the
         natives, some in canoes, and some swimming, though we lay about a quarter of a mile from
         the shore. We found them to be of the same nation which inhabited Ea-oowhe, and their
         mercantile turn prompted them to bring an immense quantity of their cloth, mats, nets,
         utensils, arms, and ornaments, which they eagerly exchanged for beads and nails. The ships
         were no sooner moored, than a prohibition was made against purchasing curiosities, and the
         natives were told to bring coco-nuts, bread-fruit, yams, and bananas, as well as hogs and
         fowls, of which we had already learnt the names. We purchased a small quantity of
         provisions the same evening, to give an example to the rest of the inhabitants, who were
         obliged to take their merchandize on shore again. The good effects of this step appeared
         the next morning, when the natives returned from shore at day-break, and had loaded their
         canoes with vegetables and fowls. Many of them came on board as freely as if we had been
         old acquaintances, and did not appear to have the least idea of distrust. One of them, a
         well made man, with a handsome open countenance, seemed to have some authority among them,
         like the chief whom we had seen on Ea-oowhe. He descended into the cabin, acquainted us
         that his name was Attahha, and received several presents, among which he sat a high value
         on iron, and on red European broad-cloth. After breakfast he went on shore with us in the
         pinnace. A coral reef surrounded the coast, at the distance of a musket-shot, and a single
         narrow pass admitted us within it, were we found the water so full of rocks and so shallow,
         that we were obliged to be carried out of the boat. A party of the marines were posted on
         the beach in case of danger, to protect the captain's clerk, who traded for provisions. The
         natives did not express either surprize or dislike at this proceeding, perhaps because they
         were unacquainted with its meaning. They received us with acclamations of joy as at
         Ea-oowhe, and desired us to sit down with them on the rocks along shore, which consisted of
         coral, and were covered with shell sand. We purchased several beautiful parroquets,
         pigeons, and doves, which they brought to us perfectly tame; and our young Borabora-man
         Mahine (or Hedèedee) traded with great eagerness for ornaments made of bright red feathers,
         which he assured us had an extraordinary value at Taheitee and the Society Islands. Here
         they were commonly pasted to aprons used in their dances, and made of the fibres of
         coco-nut, or fixed upon banana leaves, forming rhomboidal frontlets or diadems, &amp;c.
         With a degree of extasy which gave the greatest weight to his assertion, he shewed us that
         a little piece of feathered-work, as broad as two or three fingers, would purchase the
         largest hog in his island. Both this youth and O-Mai were much pleased with the inhabitants
         of these islands, and began to understand their language tolerably well.</p>

      <p>We left the beach after the first acquaintance with the natives, and ascended a few feet
         into a wild forest consisting of tall trees, intermixed with shrubberies. This wood though
         narrow, being in many places not above one hundred yards wide, was continued along the
         shore of Van Diemen's road, being more or less open in various parts. Beyond it the whole
         island was perfectly level. We walked across a piece of uncultivated land, about five
         hundred yards wide, which adjoined to the wood. Part of it appeared to have been planted
         with yams, but the rest was full of grass, and had a little swamp in the middle, where the
         purple water-hen, or poule sultane, resided in great numbers. As soon as we left this, we
         entered into a lane about six feet wide, between two fences of reed, which enclosed
         extensive plantations on each side. Here we met many of the natives, who were travelling to
         the beach with loads of provisions, and courteously bowed their heads as they passed by us
         in sign of friendship, generally pronouncing some monosyllable or other, which seemed to
         correspond to the Taheitian tayo. The enclosures, plantations, and houses were exactly in
         the same style as at Ea-oowhe, and the people had never failed to plant odoriferous shrubs
         round their dwellings. The mulberry, of which the bark is manufactured into cloth, and the
         bread-tree, were more scarce than at the Society Isles, and the apple of those islands was
         entirely unknown, but the shaddock well supplied its place. The season of spring, which
         revived the face of all nature, adorning every plant with blossoms, and inspiring with
         joyful songs the feathered tribe, doubtless contributed in a great measure to make every
         object pleasing in our eyes. But the industry and elegance of the natives, which they
         displayed in planting every piece of ground to the greatest advantage, as well as in the
         neatness and regularity of all their works, demanded our admiration, whilst it gave us room
         to suppose, that they enjoyed a considerable degree of happiness.</p>

      <p>One of the lanes between the enclosures led us to a little grove, which we admired for its
         irregularity. An immense casuarina tree far out-topped the rest, and its branches were
         loaded with a vast number of blackish creatures, which we took for crows at a distance, but
         which proved to be bats when we came nearer. They clung to the twigs, by the hooked claws,
         which are at the extremity of their webbed fingers and toes; sometimes they hung with the
         head downwards, and sometimes the reverse. We shot at them, and brought down six or eight
         at once, besides wounding several others which held fast on the tree. They were of the kind
         which is commonly called the vampyre , and measured from three to four feet between the
         expanded wings. A great number of them were disturbed at our firing, and flew from the tree
         very heavily, uttering a shrill piping note; some likewise arrived from remote parts at
         intervals to the tree, but the greatest number remained in their position, and probably go
         out to feed only by night. As they live chiefly upon fruit, it is likely that they commit
         great depredations in the orchards of the natives, some of whom being present when we
         fired, seemed very well pleased with the death of their enemies. We had seen some of them
         who had caught these bats alive, and placed them in a cage of wickerwork very ingeniously
         contrived, with an entrance like that of a fish-basket, where the animal could easily be
         put in, but could not come out again. They likewise assured us the bats were very
         mordacious, for which purpose they seemed indeed to be well provided with large sharp
         teeth.</p>

      <p>We had already observed at Taheitee, at the Society Islands, and even at Ea-oowhe, that
         wherever we met with a casuarina, a burying-place was at hand. Therefore, at sight of this
         venerable tree, which was hung with ill-omened creatures, we immediately conjectured that
         it would lead us to a cemetery or place of worship, and the event shewed that we were not
         mistaken. We found a beautiful green lawn, enclosed on all sides by shady bushes and trees,
         amongst which casuarinas, pandangs, and wild sago-palms appeared with their various tints
         of green. A row of Barringtonias, as big as the loftiest oaks, formed one side of it, and
         strewed it with their large blushing flowers. At the upper end of it, there was a rising
         two or three feet high, set out with coral-stones cut square. The area above was covered
         with a green sod, like the rest of the lawn. Two steps, likewise of coral rock, led up to
         this part, in the midst of which a house was situated, exactly like that which we saw at
         Ea-oowhe. Its length was about twenty, the breadth fifteen, and the height of the ridge ten
         feet. The roof descended sloping nearly to the ground, and was made of banana leaves. We
         entered into this building with only one of the natives, the rest keeping at some distance.
         We found the floor covered with broken pieces of white coral rock, and in one corner a heap
         of blackish pebbles, about eight feet long, which was elevated a foot above the white
         stones. The native told us that a man lay buried there, and pointing to the place where his
         little finger had formerly been cut away, he plainly signified that when his maduas or
         parents died, they mutilated their hands. We found two pieces of wood a foot long, carved
         into some resemblance of the human figure, like those which are called e-tee at Taheitee,
         but they were treated in the same manner, that is without the least degree of respect or
         veneration, being frequently trod upon and kicked about. These burying-places, which are
         called a-Fayetooca in the language of the country, are always delightfully situated on
         green lawns, and surrounded withe the finest groves. That which I have here described, was
         drawn by Mr. Hodges, and an exact representation of it is inserted in captain Cook's own
         account of this voyage.</p>

      <p>We continued our walk through the plantations, and met with very few inhabitants, they
         being almost all gone towards the trading-place. Those we saw passed by us, or continued
         their occupations without stopping on our account. Neither curiosity, nor distrust and
         jealousy excited them to prohibit our farther progress; on the contrary, they always spoke
         in a kind tone to us, which sufficiently characterized their disposition. We looked into
         many of the houses and found them empty, but always laid out with mats, and delightfully
         situated among odoriferous shrubs. Sometimes they were separated from the plantations by a
         little fence, through which a door, like those of Ea‑oowhe, gave admittance, which could be
         shut on the inside. In that case only the area, which this fence enclosed around the hut,
         was planted with the odoriferous grove, which is so much in request with the natives. A
         walk of three miles brought us to the eastern shore of the island, where it forms a deep
         angle, which Tasman called Maria Bay. Where we fell in with it, the ground sloped
         imperceptibly into a sandy beach; but as we walked along towards the north point, we found
         it rose perpendicularly, and in some places it was excavated and overhanging. It consisted,
         however, entirely of coral, which is a strong proof of some great change on our globe, as
         this rock can only be formed under water. Whether it was left bare by a gradual diminution
         of the sea, or perhaps by a more violent revolution which our earth may formerly have
         suffered, I shall not venture to determine. So much, however, may be assumed as a
         certainty, that if we suppose a gradual diminution of the sea, at the rate which they
         pretend to have observed in Sweden , the emersion of this island must be of so modern date,
         that it is matter of astonishment how it came to be covered with soil, herbage, and
         forests: so well stocked with inhabitants, and so regularly adorned as we really found it.
         We picked up a quantity of shells at the foot of the steep rock, where we sometimes waded
         in water to the knees upon a reef, on account of the flood tide which was advancing. We
         likewise met with several natives returning from the trading-place, who sold us a number of
         fish-hooks and ornaments, a fish-net made like our casting-nets, knit of very firm though
         slender threads, some mats and pieces of cloth. We likewise purchased of them an apron,
         consisting of many wheels or stars of plaited coco-nut fibres, about three or four inches
         in diameter, cohering together by the projecting points, and ornamented with small red
         feathers and beads cut out of shells. Finding that the water encreased too fast upon us, we
         looked out for an ascent to the top of the rock, and having with some difficulty found one,
         we re-entered the plantations, where we observed the weeds rooted out with great care and
         laid in heaps to dry. After a long walk, during which we missed our way, and engaged one of
         the natives to become our guide, we entered a long narrow lane between two fences, which
         led us directly to the Fayetòoca or burying-place we had left before. Here we found
         captains Cook and Furneaux, and Mr. Hodges, with a great number of natives, seated on the
         fine lawn. They were in conversation with an old blear-eyed man, who had a good deal of
         weight among the rest of the people, and was always accompanied by a number of them
         wherever he went. We were told that he had conducted our gentlemen to two fayetòocas, and
         had pronounced a solemn speech or prayer, with his face directed to the building, but at
         times turning to captain Cook, and addressing the words to him, in a questioning tone. In
         these moments he always made a short pause, as if he expected an answer, and seeing a nod
         ensue, proceeded with his speech. Sometimes, however, his memory seemed to fail, upon which
         he was prompted by another man who sat near him. From this ceremony, and the place where it
         was performed, we conjectured that he was a priest. However, as far as we could see into
         their religious notions, it did not appear that they practised any kind of idolatry;
         neither did they seem to have any particular veneration for birds like the Taheitians, but
         to worship a supreme invisible Being. What may have induced them, as well as the people of
         Taheitee and the Society Isles, to unite their repositories of the dead and their places of
         worship in one, remains in obscurity. The religious tenets of a people are the last things
         which strangers become acquainted with, whose knowledge of the language is commonly too
         imperfect. Besides this, the dialect of the church frequently differs from the common
         dialect, and thus religion is veiled in mysteries, especially where there are priests to
         take advantage of the credulity of mankind.</p>

      <p>From this place we returned to the sea shore, where a brisk trade for vegetables, fowls,
         and hogs was carried on. Here we bought a large flat shield or breast-plate, of a roundish
         bone, white and polished like ivory, about eighteen inches in diameter, which appeared to
         have belonged to an animal of the cetaceous tribe. We likewise found a new musical
         instrument, consisting of eight, nine, or ten slender reeds, about nine inches long, joined
         to each other by some fibres of coco-nut core. The length of its reeds seldom varied much,
         and the long and short ones were placed promiscuously; a notch was formed at the top of
         each, and the method of playing was only to slide the instrument backwards and forwards
         along the lips. It had commonly not above four or five different notes, and we never met
         with one which included a whole octave. Its resemblance to the syrinx, or Pan's flute of
         the civilized Greeks, dignified it much more than any music which it contained. From the
         method of playing it, the lovers of music will easily conceive that this divine art is
         entirely in its infancy among the inhabitants. The vocal part, which is the same as we had
         already observed it at Ea-oowhe, is very far from being unharmonious, and the women beat
         time to it by snapping their fingers very exactly; but its whole extent is only of four
         notes, and therefore cannot admit of any variety. They had likewise a flute of a
         bamboo-reed, nearly of the thickness of a German flute, which they played with the
         nostrils, like the Taheitians. They commonly had ornamented it with various little figures,
         burnt in, and pierced four or five holes in it, whereas the Taheitian flute had but three
         in all. The method of ornamenting wood by burning figures into it, was frequently observed
         in their bowls and various other utensils.</p>

      <p>It was near sun-set when we returned on board with our collection, and found the vessels
         still surrounded by many canoes, and the natives swimming about extremely vociferous. Among
         them were a considerable number of women, who wantoned in the water like amphibious
         creatures, and were easily persuaded to come on board, perfectly naked, without professing
         greater chastity than the common women at Taheitee, and the Society Isles. Our seamen took
         advantage of their disposition, and once more offered to our eyes a scene worthy of the
         Cyprian temples. A shirt, a small piece of cloth, nay a few beads, were sometimes
         sufficient temptations, for which some of the women of Tonga-Tabboo, prostituted themselves
         without any sense of shame. This lubricity was, however, very far from being general, and
         we had reason to believe that not a single married woman was guilty of infidelity. If we
         had been acquainted with the distinction of ranks as at Taheitee, it is highly probable,
         that we should have observed no other prostitutes than such as belonged to the lowest class
         of people. Still it remains an unaccountable singularity in the character of the nations of
         this part of our globe, that they suffer any of their unmarried women to admit the
         promiscuous embraces of a multitude of lovers. Can they imagine, that after giving such an
         unlimited course to the impulses of nature, they will make better wives, than the innocent
         and the chaste? But it is in vain that we endeavour to find reasons for the arbitrary whims
         of mankind. Their opinions in respect of the sex in particular, have been infinitely
         various in all ages and countries. In some parts of India, no man of consequence will
         condescend to marry a virgin; in Europe she who has lost that character is universally
         rejected. Turks, Arabs, Tartars, and Russians are jealous even of an imaginary
         characteristic of virginity, which the native of Malabar bestows upon his Idol.</p>

      <p>None of these women ventured to stay on board after sun set, but returned to the shore to
         pass the night, like the greater part of the inhabitants, under the shade of the wild wood
         which lined the coast. There they lighted numerous fires, and were heard conversing during
         the greatest part of the night. It seems their eagerness to continue the trade with us,
         would not permit them to return to their dwellings, which were probably situated in the
         remotest part of the island. Our goods were in great repute with them. Nails, which the
         natives commonly hung on a string round the neck, or stuck through the ear, were very
         current for fowls, and smaller ones for bunches of bananas, and coco-nuts. Their fowls were
         the largest we had ever seen, and extremely well-tasted. Their plumage was commonly very
         glossy, and beautifully coloured with red and gold. Our sailors bought numbers of them, in
         order to enjoy the barbarous amusement of seeing them fight. From the time of our leaving
         Huahine, they had daily followed the cruel occupation of tormenting these poor birds, by
         trimming their wings, and incensing them against each other. They had so well succeeded
         with those of Huahine, that some of them fought with the most desperate fury of true
         game-cocks; but they were well disappointed with those which they purchased at
         Tonga-Tabboo, and as they could not make them fight, they were forced to eat them in
         revenge.</p>

      <p><date>[Tuesday 5.]</date>Early the next morning, the captain's friend Attahha or Attagha
         (see p.447.) came on board in one of the first canoes, and breakfasted with us. He was
         drest in mats, one of which, on account of the coolness of the morning, he had drawn over
         his shoulders. He resembled all other uncivilized people in the circumstance that his
         attention could not be fixed to one object for any space of time, and it was difficult to
         prevail on him to sit still, whilst Mr. Hodges drew his portrait. An excellent print,
         executed by Mr. Sherwin, has been made from his drawing, which expresses the countenance of
         this chief, and the mild character of the whole nation, better than any description. It is
         inserted in captain Cook's account of this voyage, and represents Attahha in the action of
         thanksgiving, laying a nail on his head, which he had received as a present. After
         breakfast, the captains and my father prepared to return to the shore with him; but just as
         he was going out of the cabin, he happened to see a Taheitian dog running about the deck;
         at this sight he could not conceal his joy, but clapped his hands on his breast, and
         turning to the captain, repeated the word goorree near twenty times. We were much surprised
         to hear that he knew the name of an animal which did not exist in his country, and made him
         a present of one of each sex, with which he went on shore in an extasy of joy. That the
         name of dogs should be familiar to a people, who are not possessed of them, seems to prove
         either that this knowledge has been propagated by tradition from their ancestors, who
         migrated hither from other islands, and from the continent; or that they have had dogs upon
         their island, of which the race, by some accident, is become extinct; or lastly, that they
         still have an intercourse with other islands where these animals exist.</p>

      <p>I remained on board all this day, to arrange the collection of plants and birds which we
         had made upon our first excursion, and which was far from despicable, considering the small
         size of the island. The natives continued to croud about our vessels in a number of canoes,
         whilst many were swimming to and from the shore, who were probably not rich enough to
         possess a canoe. These embarkations were of different construction. The common small
         trading-canoes were sharp-bottomed, and ended in a sharp edge at each extremity, which was
         covered with a board or deck, because their narrow form frequently exposed these parts to
         an entire submersion, which would have filled them with water without this precaution. They
         commonly had a slight out-rigger or balancer, made of a few poles, to prevent their
         oversetting. The body of the canoe consisted of several planks, of a hard brown wood, sewed
         together with strings made of the fibrous coco-nut core, and so artfully joined that they
         appeared to be remarkably tight. The Taheitians simply bore holes in each plank, through
         which they pass their strings; but by this means their canoes are always leaky. At
         Tongo-Tabboo they dub the inside of the plank in such a manner as to leave a projecting
         lift or rim close to the edge, and through this they pass their threads. Along the deck or
         narrow board at each extremity are placed seven or eight knobs, which seem to be an
         imitation of the little fins, (pinnulœ spuriœ) on the belly of bonitos, albecores, or
         mackarels; and I cannot but conjecture that the natives have taken these swift fishes for
         their models in the construction of their boats. Though these canoes are commonly fifteen
         or eighteen feet long, yet they are as neatly and smoothly polished as our best
         cabinet-work, which must appear the more surprising when we consider that the tools of the
         natives are only wretched bits of coral, and rasps made of the skins of rays. Their paddles
         were equally well polished, of the same wood as the canoe, and had short rhomboidal broad
         blades, like those of Taheitee. The other sort of canoes were constructed for sailing, and
         persons skilled in nautical matters acknowledge that they were admirably well adapted for
         this purpose. We saw one of them in Maria Bay, consisting of two joined together, of which
         the planks were sewed in the same manner as in the common canoe; but they were covered all
         over, and had a kind of elevated stage or platform, like the Taheitian war-canoes . Some of
         them may carry one hundred and fifty men; and their sails, which are latine, are made of
         strong mats, in which the rude figure of a tortoise or a cock, &amp;c. is sometimes
         represented . As a farther detail would be tedious to most readers, and instructive only to
         mariners, I omit it in this place, and refer those who wish to be better acquainted with
         the subject to the accurate figures with which Mr. Hodges has ornamented captain Cook's
         account of this voyage. I shall only observe, that it appears probably from the good
         construction of the sailing-boats, that the inhabitants of these islands are more
         experienced mariners than those of Taheitee and the Society Isles.</p>

      <p>Among the great numbers of people who surrounded our ships, we observed several whose hair
         seemed to be burnt at the ends, and were strewed with a white powder. Upon examination we
         found that this powder was nothing else than lime, made of shells or coral, which had
         corroded or burnt the hair. The taste of powdering was at its height in this island. We
         observed a man who had employed a blue powder, and many persons of both sexes who wore an
         orange powder, made of turmerick. St. Jerom, who preached against the vanities of the age,
         very seriously reprehends a similar custom in the Roman ladies: " Ne irrufet crines, et
         anticipet sibi ignes Gehènnœ!" Thus, by an admirable similarity of follies, the modes of
         the former inhabitants of Europe are in full force among the modern antipodes; and our
         insipid beaux, whose only pride is the invention of a new fashion, are forced to share that
         slender honour with the uncivilized natives of an isle in the South Seas.</p>

      <p>My father did not return from his excursion till the evening, having proceeded a
         considerable way towards the south end of the island. At noon a smart shower had obliged
         him to retire into a plantation and to take shelter in a house. Fortunately for him the
         owner of this cottage was at home, and immediately invited him to sit down on the clean
         mats which covered the floor, whilst he went to provide some refreshments. In a few moments
         he brought several coco-nuts, and having opened his oven under ground, took out some
         bananas and fishes, wrapped in leaves, which were perfectly well done and delicious to the
         taste. The manner of cooking provisions is therefore exactly the same as at Taheitee; nor
         are the natives less inclinable to acts of hospitality and benevolence, though these
         virtues were not so frequently exercised towards us, because we commonly found the country
         quite deserted, the inhabitants being drawn together towards our trading-place. The
         hospitable man was rewarded with nails and beads, with which he performed the fagafetai, by
         laying them on his head, and accompanied my father back to the beach, carefully carrying a
         number of spears and clubs for him, which he had purchased on the road.</p>

      <p><date>[Wednesd. 6.]</date>The harmless disposition of these good people could not secure
         them against those misfortunes, which are too often attendant upon all voyages of
         discovery. Our goods tempted them at least as much as they had tempted the Taheitians, and
         they were consequently equally disposed to pilfer. The captains had not been long on shore
         the next day, when one of the natives took an opportunity of stealing a jacket out of our
         boat. In a few moments no less than seven shot were fired, without the captain's orders,
         though in his presence, at the thief, who first dived in the water, and at last ran into
         the croud, by which means several innocent people were wounded. Notwithstanding this
         severity, the good-nature of the people was such, that they did not forsake the
         trading-place, or take umbrage at our proceeding, but heard with unconcern the balls
         whistling about their ears. A few hours afterwards, one of them was equally nimble on board
         our ship, and luckily slipping into the master's cabin stole from thence several
         mathematical books, a sword, a ruler, and a number of trifles of which he could never make
         the least use. He was seen making his escape in a canoe, and a boat being dispatched after
         him, he threw all the stolen effects overboard. These were picked up by another of our
         boats, whilst the first continued in the pursuit of the thief. Our men fired a musket into
         the stern of his canoe, upon which he and some others with him jumped into the sea. The
         thief was still hunted with incredible eagerness, but displayed a most wonderful agility,
         diving several times under the boat, and once unshipping the rudder. At last one of our
         people darted the boat-hook at him, and catching him under the ribs, dragged him into the
         boat; but he watched his opportunity, and notwithstanding his loss of blood, leaped into
         the sea again, and escaped to some canoes, which came from the shore to his assistance. It
         is remarkable that even such a disposition for cruelty, as had been displayed in the
         pursuit of this poor wretch, did not deprive us of the confidence and affection of his
         country-men. The captains brought Attagha and another chief on board with them to dinner,
         and the trade was carried on as quietly as if nothing had happened. The chief who came with
         Attagha appeared to be of a superior rank, because the latter, who used to sit at table
         with us on former occasions, now retreated a few steps, sat down on the floor, and could
         not be prevailed upon to eat in his sight. He was a blear-eyed, elderly man, and having a
         great influence on the people in the canoes, was called the admiral by our sea-men. His
         dress did not in the least indicate his superior dignity, probably because these islanders
         are little acquainted with the refinements of luxury, though on the other hand they seem to
         behave with great submission to their men of rank, directly contrary to what we had
         observed at the Society Isles. The respect which Attagha paid to the other chief, was
         however trifling in comparison of that which we heard of on shore after dinner. Here we
         found a well-looking middle-aged man, sitting on the ground at the trading-place, and all
         the croud forming a circle about him. Some of our sportsmen acquainted us, that they had
         met with him near Maria Bay, where the other natives passing by had prostrated themselves
         on the ground before him, kissed his feet, and put them on their necks. Upon enquiry, they
         had been repeatedly told, that he was the chief of the whole island, in the same manner as
         Cookee (captain Cook) was chief of our ships, and that they called him
         Ko-Haghee-too-Fallango . Whether this was his name or his title I cannot determine, as we
         never heard it mentioned again by the natives; but they all agreed in telling us, that he
         was their Areeghee or king. They added that his name was Latoo-Nipooroo, of which we
         concluded that the former part (Latoo) was a title, it being same which Schouten and Le
         Maire, the Dutch navigators in the year 1616, found at the Cocos, Traytors, and Horne
         islands, which are situated in this neighbourhood, only a few degrees to the northward . We
         were confirmed in this opinion by the great correspondence of the vocabularies, which these
         intelligent seamen have left us, with the language which was spoken at Tonga-Tabboo, and
         still more so by the entire similarity in the behaviour and customs of these islanders. The
         captains walked up to the Latoo, and made him a number of presents, which he received with
         so much gravity and seeming indifference, as bordered upon stupidity. Amongst other things
         they put a shirt on him, with a great deal of trouble, because his behaviour was most
         aukwardly passive. He did not return any thanks for the presents which he received, till an
         old woman sitting behind him, had repeatedly excited him to express his gratitude. Upon
         this he held each separate article over his head, and pronounced the word fagafetai, like
         the meanest of his subjects. The priest, who had led our captains to the places of worship,
         on the first day after our arrival, was seated in the same circle, and drank vast
         quantities of the intoxicating pepper-water , which was served in little square cups made
         of banana-leaves curiously folded. At his desire, we were very politely presented with this
         dainty beverage, and in pure civility tasted of it. It had a nauseous insipid taste, which
         was afterwards followed by a strong pungency, and its colour was somewhat milky. The holy
         man took such large and frequent draughts of this stuff every evening, as to become
         perfectly intoxicated. No wonder then that his memory failed him, when he was at prayer
         (see p. 454.) that his whole habit of body was lean and scabby, his face wrinkled, and his
         eyes red, and " purging thick amber ." He had great authority among all the people,. and a
         number of servants attended to supply him with replenished cups. The presents which he
         received from us, he retained in his own custody, whereas Attagha and several other chiefs,
         gave up to their superiors whatever the captains had presented to them. The priest had a
         daughter, who received many presents from our people. She was extremely well featured, and
         fairer than most of the women of this country, who seemed to pay her some degree of
         deference. A fairer complexion, and softer features than those of the common people, are
         the natural effects of an easy inactive life, unexposed to the blaze of a tropical sun, and
         pampered with a profusion of the best productions of the country. Must we not conclude
         therefore that the beginnings of luxury will be introduced even here under the cloak of
         religion, and that another nation will be added to the many dupes of voluptuous
         priest-craft? So small a spark as the cunning of a single man may in time kindle a dreadful
         and irresistible fire! The obedience and submission with which these people revere their
         chiefs, are evident proofs that their government, though perhaps not perfectly despotic, is
         yet far from being democratical; and this kind of political constitution seems likely to
         facilitate the introduction of luxury. This seems to hold good likewise in regard to many
         islands in the western part of the Pacific Ocean, since the faithful descriptions of
         Schouten, Le Maire, and Tasman, who visited them, correspond in every material particular
         with our own observations. The general disposition for trading, and the kind and friendly
         reception which strangers have almost constantly met with in every island belonging to this
         group, prevailed upon us to give these discoveries of Schouten and Tasman, the name of the
         Friendly Islands. Schouten's boats were indeed attacked at Cocos, Traitors, Hope, and Horne
         Islands; but these attacks were inconsiderable, though severely punished on the part of the
         Dutch navigator, who, after the first disturbance at Horne Island, lay there nine days in
         perfect good understanding with the natives. Tasman, who twenty-seven years afterwards saw
         several islands near six degrees to the southward of those which Schouten has visited, was
         received with every demonstration of peace and friendship, though he was the first European
         that discovered them. Whether this behaviour was only a consequence of the intelligence
         which the natives of Tonga-Tabboo and Ana-mocka, (Ansterdam and Rotterdam Islands,) might
         have received from those of Cocos, Hope, and Horne Islands, concerning the superior
         strength of the strangers and the havock which they had made; or whether it was the natural
         effect of their peaceable disposition, I cannot venture to determine, though I am inclined
         to adopt the former opinion. Captain Wallis probably saw Cocos and Traitors Islands in
         1767, which he called Boscawen's and Keppel's Isles; but his people did the natives no
         hurt, except frightening them with the discharge of a single musket. M. de Bougainville saw
         some of the north-eastermost isles belonging to this group, of which the inhabitants had
         the same general character. He called his discovery the Archipel des Navigateurs , justly
         enough, as many ships have fallen in with it. Since Tasman's time, no other navigator has
         had any intercourse with the isle of Amsterdam, which he discovered, previous to our
         arrival. During a space, therefore, of one hundred and thirty years, they have not
         materially changed their manners, dresses, way of living, disposition, &amp;c. &amp;c. Our
         ignorance of their language prevented our obtaining positive proof that they still
         preserved, by tradition, the memory of former visitors; but they possessed some nails,
         which must have been brought to the island in Tasman's time. We purchased one of these
         nails, which was very small and almost consumed with rust, but had been carefully preserved
         by being fixed on a wooden handle, probably to serve the purposes of a googe or borer, and
         is now deposited in the British Museum. We likewise bought some small earthen pots,
         perfectly black with soot on the outside, and suspected them to be memorials of Tasman's
         voyage; but afterwards we rather believed that they were manufactured by the natives
         themselves. The accounts of Schouten, Tasman, and M. de Bougainville agree with ours, in
         respect of the agility with which the natives committed petty thefts. Tasman and captain
         Wallis have likewise observed their custom of cutting off the little finger; and according
         to Schouten's and Le Maire's circumstantial narratives, the natives of Horne Island were as
         submissive to their king as those of Tonga-Tabboo. The experience of the superior power of
         the strangers, made them respectful even to servility towards the Dutch; their king
         prostrated himself before a Dutch purser, and their chiefs placed their necks under his
         foot . These excessive marks of submission seem to border upon meanness and cowardice; but
         we never had reason to suppose them tinctured with these vices. Their behaviour towards us
         was commonly accompanied with that freedom and boldness which the rectitude of intentions
         inspires; and though really polite, was never unbecoming. Here, however, as in all other
         societies of men, we found exceptions to the general character, and had reason to lament
         the behaviour of vicious individuals. Dr. Sparrman and myself having left the beach where
         the Latoo attracted the attention of all our people, entered the wood in pursuit of farther
         discoveries in our branch of science. The first discharge of my fowling-piece at a bird
         brought three natives towards us, with whom we entered into conversation, as far as our
         superficial knowledge of their tongue would permit. Soon after, Dr. Sparrman stepped aside
         into a thicket in search of a bayonet, which he had lost from the end of his musket. One of
         the natives, finding the temptation of the moment irresistible, grasped my fowling-piece,
         and struggled to wrest it from me. I called to my companion, and the two other natives ran
         away, unwilling to become accomplices in this attack. In the struggle our feet were
         entangled in a bush, and we both fell together; but the native, seeing he could not gain
         his point, and perhaps dreading the arrival of Dr. Sparrman, got up before me, and took
         that opportunity of running off. My friend joined me immediately; and we concluded, that if
         there was something treacherous or vicious in the behaviour of this fellow, our separation
         was also imprudent, because it had furnished him with an opportunity to exercise his
         talents. We continued strolling about for some time, without any sinister accident, and
         returned to the trading-place on the beach, where we found almost all the people whom we
         had left. Many of them were now seated in different little groups, which appeared to be so
         many separate families, and consisted of persons of various ages and sexes. They were all
         in conversation, of which no doubt the arrival of our ships furnished the topics; and many
         of their women amused themselves either with singing or playing at ball. There was a young
         girl in particular, whose features were more regular than common, her eyes sparkling with
         vivacity, her whole frame admirably proportioned, and, what was most remarkable here, her
         long jetty hair hanging down in graceful curls on her neck. This girl, lively and easy in
         all her actions, played with five gourds, of the size of small apples, perfectly globular;
         she threw them up into the air one after another continually, and never failed to catch
         them all with great dexterity, at least for a quarter of an hour. The musical ladies again
         performed the same tune which we had already heard at Ea-oowhe, the different voices
         falling in with each other very harmoniously, and sometimes joining all together as in
         chorus. Though I never saw the natives of these islands dance, yet we may add this
         amusement to the list of those which they are acquainted with, from their own accounts and
         gestures whenever they sold us their aprons made of stars of coco-nut core, and ornamented
         with shell-work and red feathers, or such as were curiously wrought of mats in resemblance
         of fret-work. From these gestures I have great reason to suppose that their dances are of a
         dramatic kind, and public, like those which I have spoken of in the Society Isles, (see
         pag. 398). Schouten and Le Maire likewise strongly confirm this supposition by their
         account of the dances at Horne Island . It appeared, upon the whole, that the customs and
         language of these islanders have a great affinity with those of the Taheitians, and that it
         would not therefore be very singular to find a coincidence even in their amusements. The
         greatest differences between these two tribes, who must have originated from the same
         stock, seem to be owing to the different nature of their islands. The Society Isles are
         well furnished with wood, and the tops of their mountains are still covered with
         inexhaustible forests. At the Friendly Isles this article is much scarcer, the surface (at
         least of those which we have seen) being almost entirely laid out in plantations. The
         natural consequence is, that the houses are lofty and of immense extent in the first group
         of islands; but much smaller and less convenient in the last. In one the canoes are
         numerous, I may almost say innumerable, and many of a vast size; and, in the other, very
         few in number, and much smaller. The mountains of the Society Isles continually attract the
         vapours from the atmosphere, and many rivulets descent from the broken rocks into the
         plain, where they wind their serpentine course and glide smoothly to the sea. The
         inhabitants of those islands take advantage of this gift of bountiful nature, and not only
         drink of the salutary element, but likewise bathe so frequently in it that no impurity can
         long adhere to their skin. It is very different with a people who are absolutely denied
         this blessing, and who must either content themselves with putrid stagnant rain-water in a
         few dirty pools, or go entirely without it. They are obliged to have recourse to expedients
         in order to preserve a certain degree of cleanliness, which may preclude various
         distempers. They therefore cut off their hair, and shave or clip their bears, which
         doubtless makes them look more unlike the Taheitians than they would otherwise do. Still
         these precautions are not sufficient, especially as they have no fluid for drinking in any
         quantity. The body is therefore very subject to leprous complaints, which are perhaps
         irritated by the use of the pepper-root water or awa. Hence also that burning or blistering
         on the cheek-bones which we observed to be so general among this tribe, that hardly an
         individual was free from it, and which can only be used as a remedy against some disorders.
         The soil of the Society Isles in the plains and vallies is rich, and the rivulets which
         intersect it, supply abundance of moisture. All sorts of vegetables therefore thrive with
         great luxuriance upon it, and require little attendance or cultivation. This profusion is
         become the source of that great luxury among the chiefs which we do not meet with at
         Tonga-Tabboo. There the coral rock is covered only with a thin bed of mould, which
         sparingly affords nourishment to all sorts of trees; and the most useful of all, the
         bread-fruit tree, thrives imperfectly on the island, as it is destitute of water, except
         when a genial shower happens to impregnate and fertilize the ground. The labour of the
         natives is therefore greater than that of the Taheitians, and accounts for the regularity
         of the plantations, and the accurate division of property. It is likewise to this source we
         must ascribe it, that they have always set a higher value on their provisions than on their
         tools, dresses, ornaments, and weapons, though many of these must have cost them infinite
         time and application. They very justly conceive the articles of food to be their principal
         riches, of which the loss is absolutely not to be remedied. If we observed their bodies
         more slender and their muscles harder than those of the Taheitians, this seems to be the
         consequence of a greater and more constant exertion of strength. Thus, perhaps, they become
         industrious by force of habit, and when agriculture does not occupy them, they are actuated
         to employ their vacant hours in the fabrick of that variety of tools and instruments on
         which they bestow so much time, patience, labour, and ingenuity. This industrious turn has
         also led them, in the cultivation of all their arts, to so much greater perfection than the
         Taheitians. By degrees they have hit upon new inventions, and introduced an active spirit
         and enlivening chearfulness even into their amusements. Their happiness of temper they
         preserve under a political constitution, which does not appear to be very favourable to
         liberty; but we need not go so far from home to wonder at such a phӕnomenon, when one of
         the most enslaved people in all Europe, are characterised as the merriest and most
         facetious of mankind. Still there may be more sincerity in the chearfulness of the natives
         of Tonga-Tabboo; for, exclusive of great and almost servile submission, their king does not
         seem to exact any thing from them, which, by depriving them of the means to satisfy the
         most indispensible wants of nature, could make them miserable. Be this as it may, so much
         seems to be certain, that their systems of politics and religion, from their similarity
         with the Taheitian, as far as we could judge, must have had one common origin, perhaps in
         the mother country, from whence both these colonies issued. Single dissonant customs, and
         opinions may have acceded to the primitive ideas; in proportion as various accidents, or
         human caprices have given rise to them. The affinity of their languages is still more
         decisive. The greatest part of the necessaries of life, common to both groups of islands,
         the parts of the body, in short the most obvious and universal ideas, were expressed at the
         Society and Friendly Isles nearly by the same words. We did not find that sonorousness in
         the Tonga-Tabboo dialect, which is prevalent in that of Taheitee, because the inhabitants
         of the former have adopted the F, K, and S, so that their language is more replete with
         consonants. This harshness is compensated however by the frequent use of the liquid
         letters, L, M, N; and of the softer vowels E and I, to which we must add that kind of
         singing tone, which they generally retain even in common conversation. _________But it is
         time to return from this digression.</p>

      <p>We did not part from our friends till sun-set, promising to return to them once more the
         next morning. Our ships were well provided with bananas, yams, and coco-nuts; and,
         considering the small size of the island, as well as our short stay, sixty or eighty hogs,
         besides a vast number of large fowls, were a surprising acquisition. During our stay we had
         searched the country in vain for water, and the master had been sent to the eastward to
         survey Maria Bay, and the low isles which shelter that harbour. The situation of these
         islands he found very exactly represented in the charts of the ever accurate Tasman, and on
         one of them where he landed, he saw an astonishing number of speckled water-snakes, with
         flat tails, which are harmless, and distinguished in the system of Linnӕus, by the name of
         colubri laticaudati. In our branch we had not been unsuccessful, this little island having
         afforded us several new plants, among which was a new species of jesuit's bark, or
         cinchona, of which the bitter bark may perhaps be equally efficacious with that of Peru. We
         also collected several birds unknown before, and purchased some live species, particularly
         of the parrot and pigeon tribe, of the natives, who seem to be very expert fowlers. But it
         did not appear to us, that the pigeons, which many carried perched on crooked sticks, were
         marks of distinction, though Schouten at Horne Island where the same custom prevails, is of
         that opinion . In the last boat which had brought our people on board in the evening, the
         Latoo or king had sent a great quantity of vegetables, together with a whole hog roasted,
         or dressed under ground, as a present to the captain. In the morning therefore, we embarked
         early in the pinnace, and rowed to the shore to make a present in return. We found the
         Latoo sitting at a little distance from the beach; and captain Cook gave him a shirt, a
         saw, a hatchet, a brass kettle, and several articles of less moment, all which he received
         with sullen gravity; this deportment he never varied, except once, when he was seen to
         smile as he conversed with Attagha. Among the croud, we observed a single man, who differed
         from all the rest, by having suffered his hair to grow, and having twisted it into several
         round bunches, which hung wildly about his ears. This man, and the young girl mentioned
         page 468. were the only persons we met with, who had not conformed to the general custom of
         cutting off the hair.</p>

      <p>After a short conversation with the natives, of whom we bought a variety of their tools, on
         account of their elegant carving, we returned on board to breakfast, and immediately after
         weighed the anchors and set sail. The provisions lying in confused heaps on the decks,
         prevented our going into the open sea immediately. We therefore kept standing off and on,
         under shelter of this island, and did not take our departure till towards evening, when we
         shaped our course southerly.</p>

      <p><date>[Friday 8.]</date>The next morning, the weather being nearly calm, we caught a shark,
         eight feet long, consequently bigger than any we had seen before. In the afternoon we saw
         the little isle which Tasman calls Pylstaerts Island. This name refers to the birds, which
         the Dutch navigators observed there, and which in all probability were tropic birds.
         Pylstaert literally signifying arrow-tail, alludes to the two long feathers in the tail of
         this bird, from whence its French name of paille-en-queue is likewise derived . Its
         latitude is 22° 26' S. and its longitude 170° 59' W. A contrary S. W. wind which sprung up
         towards evening, obliged us to [Sunday 10.]cruize about till the 10th in the morning, when
         we came in sight of this little islet again. It is of a moderate height, and has two
         hummocks, of which the southernmost is the highest. We recovered the trade-wind by degrees,
         so that we were out of sight of this island about two o'clock in the afternoon, and having
         bid adieu to the tropical islands of this ocean, directed our course a second time towards
         New Zeeland. We had now made such good use of the four months, after our departure from
         thence, as to have crossed the South Sea in the middle latitudes, in the depth of winter,
         examined a space of more than forty degrees of longitude between the tropics, and refreshed
         our people at Taheitee, the Society Islands, and the Friendly Islands during one and thirty
         days. The season for prosecuting our discoveries in high southern latitudes advanced, and
         the savage rocks of New Zeeland were only to give us shelter, whilst we changed our
         fair-weather rigging, for such as might resist the storms and rigours of more inhospitable
         climates.</p>

      <head>CHAP. II.</head>

      <p><date>[1773. October.]</date>WE had no sooner left the torrid zone, than flocks of
         sea-fowls attended us on our course, and hovered lightly on the waves, which a favourable
         gale had raised. <date>[Tuesday 12.]</date> On the 12th an albatross appeared, among the
         rest of the inhabitants of the temperate zone, which never dare to cross the tropic, but
         roam from thence even to the polar circle; so carefully has nature allotted to each animal
         its proper place of abode.</p>

      <p><date>[Saturday 16.]</date> The weather continued fair till the 16th in the morning, when
         we had a fall of rain. Some of the people who examined the pump-well, found there a dog,
         which they brought upon deck. This creature, which had been purchased at the island of
         Huahine, like many others of the same species, had obstinately refused to take any
         nourishment, and in all probability had lived ever since in that hole without the least
         support of food, for a space of thirty-nine or forty days. The whole body was reduced to a
         mere skeleton, the legs were contracted, and he voided blood at the anus. The torments in
         which this poor animal must have lived, were a lesson to our people, to purchase only young
         puppies of this race for the future, as the grown dogs constantly refused to eat on
         board.</p>

      <p>The next night several blubbers passed by the ship, which were visible on account of their
         phosphoric light. Their luminous quality was so great, that the bosom of the sea, seemed to
         contain brighter stars than the ӕther.</p>

      <p>Sea-weed, sheer-waters, and albatrosses daily appeared, as we advanced towards New Zeeland.
         On the 19th, the sea was luminous, and on the 20th, the diving petrels arrived in flocks
         about us, and indicated the proximity of the land, which we saw the next morning at five
         o'clock. <date>[Tuesday 21.]</date>We stood in shore all the day, till four in the
         afternoon, when we were abreast of the Table Cape , and Portland Island which adjoins to it
         by a ledge of rocks. The shores were white and steep towards the sea, and we could perceive
         the huts and strong holds of the natives, like eagles airies on the top of the cliffs. A
         great number of natives ran along the rocks, in order to gaze at us, as we passed by them,
         and many seated themselves at the point which extends to the southward, but did not care to
         come off to us in their canoes. We sailed between the sunken rock and the land, and
         continued our course across Hawke's Bay, and then along shore, as it was growing dark.</p>

      <p><date>[Friday 22.]</date>In the morning we were to the south of Cape Kidnappers, and
         advanced to the Black Cape. After breakfast three canoes put off from this part of the
         shore, where some level land appeared at the foot of the mountains. They soon came on board
         as we were not very far from the land, and in one of them was a chief, who came on deck
         without hesitation. He was a tall middle-aged man, clothed in two new and elegant dresses,
         made of the New Zeeland flag or flax-plant. His hair was dressed in the highest fashion of
         the country, tied on the crown, oiled, and stuck with white feathers. In each ear he wore a
         piece of albatross-skin covered with its white down, and his face was punctured in spirals
         and curve lines. Mr. Hodges drew his portrait, and a print of it is inserted in captain
         Cook's account of this voyage. His companions sold us some fish, while he was entertained
         in the cabin. The captain presented him with a piece of red baize, some garden-seeds, two
         young pigs of each sex, and likewise three pairs of fowls. Our young Borabora man, Mahine,
         who did not understand the language of the New Zeelanders at the first interview like
         Tupaya, hearing from us that these people were not possessed of coco-nuts and yams,
         produced some of these nuts and roots with a view to offer them to the chief; but upon our
         assuring him the climate was unfavourable to the growth of palm-trees, he only presented
         the yams, whilst we made an effort to convince the chief of the value of the presents which
         he had received, and that it was his interest to keep the hogs and fowls for breeding, and
         to plant the roots. He seemed at last to comprehend our meaning, and in return for such
         valuable presents, parted with his mahèe-peh or battle-axe, which was perfectly new, its
         head well carved, and ornamented with red parrot's feathers and white dog's hair. After a
         short stay he returned on deck, where captain Cook presented him with several large nails.
         He received those with so much eagerness that he seemed to value them above any other
         present; and having observed that the captain took them out of one of the holes in the
         capstan, where his clerk had put them, he turned the capstan all round, and examined every
         hole to see if there were not some more concealed. This circumstance plainly shews how much
         the value of iron tools is advanced in the estimation of the New Zeelanders since the
         Endeavour's voyage, when they would hardly receive them in many places. Before their
         departure they gave us a heeva or warlike dance, which consisted of stamping with the feet,
         brandishing short clubs, speakers, &amp;c. making frightful contorsions of the face,
         lolling out the tongue, and bellowing wildly, but in tune with each motion. From their
         manner of treating the fowls which we had given them, we had no great reason to expect
         success in our plan of stocking this country with domestic animals, and we much feared
         whether the birds would reach the shore alive. We comforted ourselves, however, with the
         thoughts of having at least attempted what we could not hope to see accomplished.</p>

      <p>The wind, which had shifted during our interview with these savages, blew right off shore,
         and was very unfavourable. It encreased towards evening into a hard gale, during which we
         hauled our wind, and stood on different tacks for fear of being blown too far from the
         coast. Heavy rains attended this gale, and penetrated every cabin in the ship. Squalls were
         likewise frequent, and split some old sails, which were not fit to resist the violence of
         the tempest. We had not expected such a rough reception in the latitude of 40° south, and
         felt the air from the bleak mountains of New Zeeland very cold and uncomfortable, the
         thermometer <date>[Saturday 23.]</date>being at 50 degrees in the morning. A few hours of
         moderate and almost calm weather succeeded these boisterous beginning, after which the gale
         freshened to the same height as the night before. By day it abated again, and permitted us
         to run in shore, but every night it encreased and blew in furious gusts, which demanded all
         our attention. On the 24th, in the evening, we had reached the entrance of Cook's Strait,
         and saw Cape Palliser before us; <date>[Monday 25.]</date>but the next morning a gale
         sprung up, which was already so violent, at nine o'clock, that we were forced to hand our
         sails and lay to, under a single one. Though we were situated under the lee of a high and
         mountainous coast, yet the waves rose to a vast height, ran prodigiously long, and were
         dispersed into vapour as they broke by the violence of the storm. The whole surface of the
         sea was by this means rendered hazy, and as the sun shone out in a cloudless sky, the white
         foam was perfectly dazzling. The fury of the wind still encreased so as to tear to pieces
         the only sail which we had hitherto dared to shew, and we rolled about at the mercy of the
         waves, frequently shipping great quantities of water, which fell with prodigious force on
         the decks, and broke all that stood in the way. The continual strain slackened all the
         rigging and ropes in the ship, and loosened every thing, in so much that it gradually gave
         way and presented to our eyes a general scene of confusion. In one of the deepest rolls the
         arm-chest on the quarter-deck was torn out of its place and overset, leaning against the
         rails to leeward. A young gentleman, Mr. Hood, who happened to be just then to leeward of
         it, providentially escaped by bending down when he saw the chest falling, so as to remain
         unhurt in the angle which it formed with the rail. The confusion of the elements did not
         scare every bird away from us: from time to time a black shear-water hovered over the
         ruffled surface of the sea, and artfully withstood the force of the tempest, by keeping
         under the lee of the high tops of the waves. The aspect of the ocean was at once
         magnificent and terrific: now on the summit of a broad and heavy billow, we overlooked an
         unmeasurable expanse of sea, furrowed into numberless deep channels; now on a sudden the
         wave broke under us, and we plunged into a deep and dreary valley, whilst a fresh mountain
         rose to windward with a foaming crest, and threatened to overwhelm us. The night coming on
         was not without new horrors, especially for those who had not been bred up to a seafaring
         life. In the captain's cabin the windows were taken out and replaced by the dead-lights, to
         guard against the intrusion of the waves in wearing the ship. This operation disturbed from
         its retreat a scorpion, which had lain concealed in a chink, and was probably brought on
         board with fruit from the islands. Our friend Mahine assured us that it was harmless, but
         its appearance alone was horrid enough to fill the mind with apprehension . In the other
         cabins the beds were perfectly soaked in water, whilst the tremendous roar of the waves,
         the creaking of the timbers, and the rolling motion deprived us of all hopes of repose. To
         complete this catalogue of horrors, we heard the voices of sailors from time to time louder
         than the blustering winds or the raging ocean itself, uttering horrible vollies of curses
         and oaths. Without any provocation to serve as an excuse, they execrated every limb in
         varied terms, piercing and complicated beyond the power of description. Inured to danger
         from their infancy, they were insensible to its threats; and not a single reflection
         bridled their blasphemous tongues. I know of nothing comparable to the dreadful energy of
         their curses, than that disgrace to christianity the Anathema of Ernulphus . In this
         comfortless situation we continued till two o'clock the next morning, when the wind died
         away suddenly, and was succeeded in an hour's time by another from a favourable quarter. In
         the calm interval between these two winds, the ship rolled more violently than ever, so
         that the main-chains were repeatedly dipped under water, with part of the quarter-deck.</p>

      <p><date>[Tuesday 26.]</date>We sailed all this day towards the land, having been driven off
         many leagues during the storm. Pintadas, black shear-waters, and other petrels now
         surrounded us in great flocks, and we passed an albatross sitting fast asleep in the water,
         perhaps fatigued by the violence of the preceding gale.</p>

      <p>The next day we were disappointed once more at the mouth of the strait, and got a contrary
         wind, which blew a storm before night. The same weather continued for two days following,
         almost without intermission. On the <date>[Friday 29.]</date>29th, early in the morning,
         several water-spouts were seen by the officer at watch; and soon after we had a slight
         shower and a favourable change of wind. In the evening we lost sight of the Adventure our
         consort, whom we never rejoined again during this voyage. The foul wind which in the
         morning on the 30th certainly contributed to separate her from us entirely, she being so
         far astern that this wind must have had infinitely more effect upon her than upon our
         ship.</p>

      <p>It would be useless and tedious to repeat the many changes from adverse tempests to
         favourable gales which succeeded those already mentioned, and which made us despair of ever
         coming to an anchor in New Zeeland again. We were buffetted about for nine nights together,
         during which sleep scarce ever visited our eyes. <date>[1773. November.][Monday
         1.]</date>On the 1st of November we got into Cook's Strait, but the weather proved so
         inconstant, that it became contrary to us as soon as we had approached Cape Tera-wittee
         upon the Northern Island. Our situation permitted us, however, the next day <date>[Tuesday
            2.]</date>to come to an anchor in a new bay, which we discovered immediately under this
         promontory to the westward. The environs of this bay were dreary, blackish, barren
         mountains, of a great height, almost wholly destitute of woods and shrubs, and running out
         into long spits of sharp columnar rocks into the sea. The bay itself seemed to extend a
         considerable way up between the mountains, and by its direction left us in doubt, whether
         the land on which Cape Tera-wittee is situated, is not a separate island from Eaheino
         mauwe. This miserable country was, however, inhabited, and we had not been half an hour at
         anchor, before several canoes full of natives came on board. They were very despicably
         habited in old shaggy cloaks, which they called bòghee-bògghee. The smoke to which they are
         perpetually exposed in their wretched habitations, and a load of impurities which they had
         probably never washed off since their birth, perfectly concealed their real colour, and
         made them look of a vile brownish yellow. The season of winter, which was just at an end,
         had in all likelihood forced them at times to make their meals on putrid fishes, which,
         together with the use of rancid oil for the hair, had so penetrated them with an
         insufferable stench, that we could smell them at a distance. They brought a few of their
         fish-hooks and some dried tails of craw-fish to sell, for which they eagerly received our
         iron-ware and Taheitee cloth. Captain Cook likewise presented them with two pair of fowls,
         with strong injunctions to keep them for breeding; but it is hardly to be expected that
         these wretched savages will attend to the domestication of animals. In their unthinking
         situation, the first moment they have nothing ready at hand to satisfy the cravings of
         appetite, our fowls must fall the victims to their voracity. If there are any hopes of
         succeeding in the introduction of domestic animals in this country, it must be in the
         populous bays to the northward, where the inhabitants seem to be more civilized, and are
         already accustomed to cultivate several roots for their subsistence.</p>

      <p>About three o'clock in the afternoon the weather fell perfectly calm; but in a little time
         a southerly wind came up the strait, at sight of which curling the water at a distance, we
         weighed anchor and got out of the bay. And very fortunate it was that we did so, for the
         gale encreased after a few minutes to such a furious pitch, that we were hurried along with
         astonishing speed, and after passing close to the dangerous rocks of the Brothers, on which
         a most dreadful surf was breaking, we came to an anchor at night, under shelter of Cape
         Koa-maroo in Queen Charlotte's Sound.</p>

      <p><date>[Wednesd. 3.]</date>The next day, about noon, we came safely into the Ship-Cove, from
         whence we sailed on the 7th of June, near five months before. We were in great hopes of
         being rejoined here by the Adventure, because captain Cook intended to make some stay at
         this place, though the early season of the year did not promise such abundance of
         refreshments as we had enjoyed at our first visit.</p>

      <p>We had hardly dropped our anchor, before several of the inhabitants, who had been out
         fishing, came to see us in their canoes, and disposed of the fish which they had caught. We
         recollected them as some of our old friends, and called them by their names, at which they
         expressed great satisfaction, doubtless because it served to persuade them that we were
         particularly concerned for their welfare by retaining them in memory. The weather was fair
         and warm, considering the season, but our New Zeelanders were all covered with shaggy
         cloaks, which are their winter dresses. We questioned them concerning the health of their
         absent countrymen, and received various answers; but among the rest they acquainted us,
         that Goobaïa, one of their old chiefs, had chaced the two goats which we had left in the
         woods of Grass-Cove, and had killed and eaten them. This news was most unwelcome to us, as
         it destroyed all our hopes of stocking the forests of this country with quadrupeds.</p>

      <p>In the afternoon we visited all the plantations which we had left on the beach in
         Ship-Cove, on the Hippah-Rock, and on motu-Aro. We found almost all the radishes and
         turneps shot into seed, the cabbages and carrots very fine, and abundance of onions and
         parsley in good order; the peas and beans were almost entirely lost, and seemed to have
         been destroyed by rats. The potatoes were likewise all extirpated; but, from appearances,
         we guessed this to have been the work of the natives. The thriving state of our European
         pot-herbs, gave us a strong and convincing proof of the mildness of the winter in this part
         of New Zeeland, where it seems it had never frozen hard enough to kill these plants, which
         perish in our winters. The indigenous plants of this country were not yet so forward; the
         deciduous trees and shrubs, in particular, were but just beginning to look green, and the
         vivid colour of their fresh leaves well contrasted with the dark wintery hue of the
         evergreens. The flag, of which the natives prepare their hemp, was however in flower,
         together with some other early species. We collected all we could find, gathered a quantity
         of celery and scurvy-grass, and shot some water-fowl, with all which we returned on board
         in the evening. We immediately made drawings and descriptions of all that was new to us,
         and particularly of the flag, (phormium tenax.) which, on account of the excellent flax
         that may be prepared from it, deserves to be more universally known. Desirous to promote
         every improvement which may turn out a real benefit to mankind, we did not hesitate a
         moment to permit an engraving to be made from our drawing, at the request of the Earl of
         Sandwich, which is intended to ornament captain Cook's account of this voyage.</p>

      <p><date>[Thursday 4.]</date>The natives returned the next morning in more canoes than the
         preceding day, and among them was Teiratu, the chief, who had made acquaintance with us on
         the fourth of June, and had pronounced a long harrangue that day. He was now in his old
         clothes, or what the polite world would call deshabillè; quite destitute of the finery of
         chequered mats edged with dog-skin, and his hair carelessly tied in a bunch, instead of
         being combed smooth, and delectably greased with stinking oil. In short, from being the
         orator and leader of a troop of warriors, he seemed to be degraded to a simple fishmonger.
         It was with some difficulty that we recognized his features under this disguise, upon which
         he was taken into the cabin, and presented with some nails. Our iron ware, and our
         provision of Taheitee cloth, were articles of such importance to Teiratu and his people,
         that they resolved to establish themselves near us, in order to be the first to profit by
         our commerce, and perhaps to lose no opportunity of laying their hands on any thing which
         belonged to us. Our ship lay very near the beach where we intended to fill our empty casks
         with fresh water. Here we had already set up a tent for the people who were employed in
         this branch of our preparations; another for our wood-cutters, and the astronomical
         observatory. We went on shore at this place, both before and after-noon, and made our way
         through a labyrinth of climbers which crossed from one tree to another. Mahine (or
         Hedeedee) likewise came on shore with us, and roamed through its intricate forests,
         surprised at the number of different birds, their sweet melody, and their beautiful
         plumage. One of our gardens where the radishes and turneps were in flower, was remarkably
         full of small birds, which sucked the nectareous juices of the blossoms, and not seldom
         plucked them from the stalk. We shot several of them, and Mahine, who had never made use of
         fire-arms in his life before, killed his bird at the first discharge. The senses of all
         nations, not more polished than his countrymen, are infinitely more acute than ours, which
         a thousand accidents tend to impair. We never were more clearly convinced of this, than at
         Taheitee; it was very usual for the natives there, to point out small birds to us in the
         thickest trees, or ducks and other water-fowl between bushes of reeds, where not one of us
         could ever perceive them.</p>

      <p>The weather, which was warm and pleasant, facilitated our zoological researches, so that we
         brought home a number of birds in the evening.</p>

      <p><date>[Friday 5.]</date>The first intelligence which we received from the shore the next
         day, was a complaint against the natives, who had stolen during the night, a watch-coat
         from the waterers tent, and a bag filled with linen. The captain immediately went into the
         cove, where the savages had taken up their quarters, which was only separated by a single
         hill from our watering-place, and to which he had given the name of Indian Cove. Here he
         addressed himself to their chief Teiratu, who sent for the stolen goods, and returned them
         without hesitation, pretending that the theft was committed without his knowledge. Our
         people were politic enough to believe him on his word, because the address of his
         countrymen had hitherto supplied us with abundance of fish, for a very moderate
         compensation of Taheitee cloth, whilst we caught them but very sparingly. In this place
         they found one of the sows, which captain Furneaux had left in Canibal Cove; and Teiratu
         being questioned concerning its two companions, pointed to different quarters of the bay,
         whither he said they had been carried. Thus by separating the animals, and dividing them as
         a spoil, these barbarians effectually destroy the possibility of propagating the species.
         Too much occupied with the wants of the present moment, they overlook the only means of
         securing a certain livelihood to themselves, and reject every attempt to civilize them.</p>

      <p><date>[Saturday 6.]</date>They were joined by a strong party on the 6th in the afternoon,
         who came from various parts of the bay, with a great quantity of fish, and abundance of
         their clothes, arms, &amp;c. which they exchanged for Taheitee cloth. In the evening they
         retired to a beach opposite the ship, where they hauled their canoes ashore, made some
         temporary huts, lighted fires, and broiled some fish for their suppers. Early the next
         morning <date>[Sunday 7.]</date>looking about us, we found they were all gone off, not
         excepting those who had lived at the Indian Cove. We were at a loss to guess the reason of
         their sudden departure, till we perceived that they had taken away six small casks from our
         watering-place, probably for the sake of the iron hoops. It is certain, that by supplying
         us with fish for another day, they would have received three or four times the value of
         this iron, manufactured for their use; but we have already observed that they are not much
         troubled with reflections, and probably value a bird in hand more than two in a bush. We
         were the greatest sufferers on this occasion, being now reduced to catch fish for
         ourselves, though we could not spare a sufficient number of hands, and were not acquainted
         with the haunts of the fishes as well as the natives. Our people were occupied in cleaning,
         caulking, and breaming the ship, setting up and repairing the rigging, and, in short, in
         fitting her for the next southern cruize. A great party were on shore to fill our empty
         casks with fresh-water, to make provision of fuel, and to revise the ship's biscuit, which
         was in a very decayed condition. It had unfortunately been packed into new, or what are
         called green casks, the staves of which being damp, had communicated the moisture to the
         bread, a considerable part of which was perfectly rotten, and all the rest, more or less
         covered with mould. To prevent the fatal effects of this corruption, all the bread was
         carried ashore, the bad carefully selected from that which was still eatable, and this last
         put into an oven and baked over again, till it was thoroughly dried.</p>

      <p>The weather during this time was as boisterous and inconstant, as that which had so long
         kept us out of this harbour. Scarce a day passed without heavy squalls of wind, which
         hurried down with redoubled velocity from the mountains, and strong showers of rain, which
         retarded all our occupations. The air was commonly cold and raw, vegetation made slow
         advances, and the birds were only found in vallies sheltered from the chilling southern
         blast. This kind of weather in all likelihood prevails throughout the winter, and likewise
         far into the midst of summer, without a much greater degree of cold in the former, or of
         warmth in the latter season. Islands far remote from any continent, or at least not
         situated near a cold one, seem in general to have an uniform temperature of air, owing
         perhaps to the nature of the ocean which every where surrounds them. It appears from the
         meteorological journals kept at Port Egmont on the Falkland Islands , that the extremes of
         the greatest cold, and the greatest heat observed there throughout the year, do not exceed
         thirty degrees on Fahrenheit's scale. The latitude of that port is 51° 25' south; and that
         of Ship Cove in Queen Charlotte's Sound, only 41° 5'. This considerable difference of site,
         will naturally make the climate of New Zeeland infinitely milder than that of Falkland's
         Islands, but cannot affect the general hypothesis concerning the temperature of all
         islands; and the immense height of the mountains in New Zeeland, some of which are covered
         with snow throughout the year, doubtless contributes to refrigerate the air, so as to
         assimilate it to that of the Falkland's Isles, which are not so high.</p>

      <p>The inclemency of the season did not prevent the natives from rambling about in this
         spacious sound. Having been entirely forsaken by them for three days together, a party
         arrived near us on the 9th, in three canoes, one of which was elegantly carved in fretwork
         on the stern. They sold us some curiosities, and then went on shore abreast of the ship;
         but we did not remember having ever seen them before. The next day two wretched canoes
         joined these in which was our friend Towahanga with his family . He came immediately on
         board, with his little boy Khoâa and his daughter Ko-parree, and disposed of a great number
         of green nephritic stones wrought into chissels and blades of hatchets. He was introduced
         into the cabin, where captain Cook gave him many little presents, and dressed his little
         boy in one of his own white shirts. The boy was so overjoyed at his finery, that we found
         it absolutely impossible to keep him in the cabin by fair words. He was bent upon parading
         it before his countrymen on the deck, and persisted to importune us till we let him out.
         His little vanity, however, had the most disastrous consequences. An old he-goat, which
         went about our decks, to the great terror of all the New Zeelanders, took offence at the
         ludicrous figure of poor Khoâa, who was lost in the ample turns and folds of his shirt, and
         awkwardly trotted along with self-complacency. The sturdy mountaineer stepped in his way,
         and raising himself on his hind-legs, butted with his head full against him, and laid him
         sprawling on the deck in an instant. The unsuccessful efforts which the boy made to rise,
         together with his loud lamentations, so provoked the goat, that he prepared to repeat the
         compliment, and would probably have silenced this knight of the rueful countenance, if some
         of our people had not interposed. His shirt was now sullied, and his face and hands covered
         with dirt; and in this pitiful plight he returned into the cabin. His air was quite
         dejected, his eyes full of tears, and he seemed to be perfectly cured of his vanity. He
         told his misfortune, crying, to his father; but far from exciting pity, he provoked the
         savage's indignation, and received several blows as a punishment of his folly, before we
         could make his peace. We cleaned his shirt and washed him all over, which had perhaps never
         happened to him before during his life, and thus succeeded to restore him to his former
         tranquillity. However, his father, dreading a future misfortune, carefully rolled up the
         shirt, and taking off his own dress, made a bundle of it, in which he placed all the
         presents which he and his son had received.</p>

      <p><date>[Friday 12.]</date> The natives continued to sell their artificial curiosities and
         some fish to our people this day and the following, both which proved very rainy. On the
         12th, in the morning, the weather being clear again, Dr. Sparrman, my father, and myself,
         went to the Indian Cove, which we found uninhabited. A path, made by the natives, led
         through the forest a considerable way up the steep mountain, which separates this cove from
         Shag Cove . The only motive which could induce the New Zeelanders to make this path,
         appeared to be the abundance of ferns towards the summit of the mountain, the roots of that
         plant being an article of their diet. The steepest part of the path was cut in steps paved
         with shingle or slate, but beyond that the climbers impeded our progress considerably.
         About half way up, the forest ended, and the rest was covered with various shrubs and
         ferns, though it appeared to be naked and barren from the ship. At the summit we met with
         many plants which grow in the vallies and by the sea-side at Dusky Bay, owing to the
         difference of climate, which is so much more rigorous in that southern extremity of New
         Zeeland. The whole to the very top consists of the same talcous clay which is universal all
         over the island, and of a talcous stone, which when exposed to the sun and air, crumbles in
         pieces and dissolves into lamellӕ. Its colour is whitish, greyish, and sometimes tinged
         with a dirty yellowish-red, perhaps owing to irony particles. The south side of the
         mountain is clad in forests almost to the summit. The view from hence was very extensive
         and pleasing; we looked into East Bay as into a fish-pond, and saw Cape Terà-wittee beyond
         the strait. The mountains in the south arose to a vast height, and were capt with snow; and
         the whole prospect on that side was wild and chaotic. We made a fire as a memorial of our
         expedition, and then came down the same path by which we had ascended. The next morning we
         made an excursion to Long Island, where we found a number of plants and some birds which
         were new to us. In the woods on the east side we heard some petrels in holes under ground
         croaking like frogs and cackling like hens; and we supposed them to be of the little diving
         species, which I have noticed before. It seems to be a general custom of the petrel tribe
         to make their nest in subterraneous holes, as we found the blue or silvery sort lodged in
         the same manner at Dusky Bay.</p>

      <p>Ever since the 12th the weather was mild and very fair; the natives resided abreast of the
         ship, and supplied us with plenty of fish, whilst our sailors carried on their former
         amours with the women, amongst whom there was but one who had tolerable features, and
         something soft and feminine in her looks. She was regularly given in marriage by her
         parents to one of our shipmates, who was particularly beloved by this nation, for devoting
         much of his time to them, and treating them with those marks of affection which, even among
         a savage race, endear mankind to each other. To-gheeree, for so the girl was called, proved
         as faithful to her husband as if he had been a New Zeelander, and constantly rejected the
         addresses of other seamen, professing herself a married woman, (tirra-tàne). Whatever
         attachment the Englishman had to his New Zeeland wife, he never attempted to take her on
         board, foreseeing that it would be highly inconvenient to lodge the numerous retinue which
         crawled in her garments and weighed down the hair of her head. He therefore visited her on
         shore, and only by day, treating her with plenty of the rotten part of our biscuit, which
         we rejected, but which she and all her countrymen eagerly devoured. Mahine, the native of
         Borabora, whom we had on board, had been so much accustomed in his own country to obey
         every call of nature, that he did not hesitate to gratify his appetites in New Zeeland,
         though he was too clearsighted at the same time not to perceive the vast falling off from
         his own country-women. The force of instinct triumphed over his delicacy, - and can we
         wonder at it, when our civilized Europeans set him the example? His conduct towards the New
         Zeelanders in general deserves to be commended. There needed not much penetration to
         discover that their present existence was very wretched in comparison of that of the
         tropical islanders; but he also frequently expressed his pity, whilst he enumerated to us a
         variety of articles of which they were ignorant. He distributed the roots of yams to those
         who visited the ship at the Black Cape, and always accompanied the captain whenever he went
         to plant or sow a piece of ground in this harbour. He was not, like Tupaya, so much a
         master of their language as to converse freely with them, but he soon understood them much
         better than any one of us, from the great analogy of their language to his own. Our visit
         to the tropical islands had, however, contributed to make the New Zeeland dialect more
         intelligible to us than before, and we plainly perceived that it had a great affinity to
         that of the Friendly Isles, which we had just left. From such little data we can only guess
         at the probable route by which a country, so far to the south as New Zeeland, has been
         peopled.</p>

      <p><date>[Sunday 14.]</date>The weather continuing fair on the 14th at night, the captain and
         my father went on shore to the observatory with telescopes, to observe the emersion of one
         of Jupiter's satellites. The result of a great number of observations, made at different
         times by our accurate and indefatigable astronomer, Mr. William Wales, F. R. S. has
         ascertained the longitude of Queen Charlotte's Sound to be 174° 25' egast from
         Greenwich.</p>

      <p><date>[Monday 15.]</date>The next morning we accompanied the captain to East Bay, where we
         visited several small parties of the natives, in three different places. They received us
         very amicably, presented us with fish, which was always the most valuable article they had
         to give, and sold us several large hoopnets for our iron and Taheitee cloth. Towards the
         bottom of the bay we mounted on the same hill which captain Cook had ascended in his first
         voyage , intending to look out on the sea if we could perceive the Adventure. But when we
         reached the summit, we found so thick a haze on the water, that we could see no farther
         than two or three leagues. The monument which captain Cook had erected here formerly,
         consisting of a pile of loose stones, under which some coins, bullets, &amp;c. had been
         buried, was entirely demolished at present; the natives having probably suspected that a
         treasure of European goods was deposited there. At the foot of this hill some friendly
         people, like those of which captain Cook took notice at this place in his first voyage,
         came to us, and disposed of many of their arms, utensils, and dresses. In the afternoon we
         tried the hoopnets which we had bought of the natives, and had tolerable success. These
         nets are made of the split leaves of the flag, so often mentioned, after they have been
         dried and beaten. No plant promises to become so useful to Europe by transplantation as
         this flag. The hemp of flax which the New Zeelanders make of it, with their coarse
         materials, is excessively strong, soft, glossy, and white; and that which has been prepared
         again in England, has almost equalled silk in lustre. It grows on all kinds of soil, and,
         being perennial, may be cut down to the root every year, and requires scarce any attendance
         or care in the cultivation.</p>

      <p><date>[Wednesd. 17.]</date>On the 17th, we spent the forenoon in cutting down a number of
         very tall trees, of which we wished to gather the flowers, but all our efforts were in
         vain. We had no sooner cut a tree, than it hung in a thousand bindweeds and climbers from
         top to bottom, from which it was not in our power to disengage it. The three following days
         we had much rain, which confined us on board; nor did we receive any visits from the
         natives during that time.</p>

      <p><date>[Sunday 21.]</date>On the 21st in the morning, none but women came from the shore in
         two canoes, and seemed to be under great apprehensions for their men, signifying to us that
         they were gone to fight with another party. From the direction in which they pointed, we
         concluded that their enemies dwelt somewhere in Admiralty Bay.</p>

      <p><date>[Monday 22.]</date>On the 22d, the weather being mild and fair, the captain,
         accompanied by Dr. Sparrman, my father, and myself, went into West Bay, and in its deepest
         recess carried ashore two sows and a boar, with three cocks and two hens, which we set at
         liberty a good way up in the woods. We flattered ourselves that having chosen a marshy
         spot, which is not likely to be frequented by the inhabitants, the animals would be left to
         multiply their species without any molestation. A few natives only in a single canoe had
         seen us in the entrance of the bay, and probably would not suspect that we were come on so
         particular an errand. If therefore the southern isle of New Zeeland should in course of
         time be stocked with hogs and fowls, we have great reason to hope that the care with which
         we concealed them in the woods, has been the only means of preserving the race.</p>

      <p>At our return seven or eight canoes arrived from the northward, some of which, without
         paying any attention to us, went directly into Indian Cove, whilst the rest came on board
         with a great variety of dresses and arms, which they sold to our people. They were more
         dressed than we had commonly seen any, during this second stay at Queen Charlotte's Sound,
         their hair was tied up, and their cheeks painted red. All these circumstances conspired to
         confirm the account which the women had given us the day before, that their husbands were
         gone to fight, as it is usual for them to put on their best apparel on those occasions. I
         am much afraid that their unhappy differences with other tribes, were revived on our
         account. Our people not satisfied with purchasing all the hatchets of stone, patoo-patoos,
         battle-axes, clothes, green jaddes, fish-hooks, &amp;c. of which the natives of our
         acquaintance were possessed, continually enquired for more, and shewed them such large and
         valuable pieces of Taheitee cloth, as would not fail to excite their desires. It is not
         improbable that as soon as this appetite prevailed among the New Zeelanders, they would
         reflect that the shortest way to gratify it, would be to rob their neighbours of such
         goods, as the Europeans coveted. The great store of arms, ornaments, and clothes which they
         produced at this time, seemed to prove that such a daring and villainous design had really
         been put in execution; nor was it to be supposed that this could have been accomplished
         without bloodshed.</p>

      <p><date>[Tuesday 23.]</date>In the morning, which was very foggy, the natives at our
         watering-place were seen to eat a root boiled or baked by means of hot stones; and Mr.
         Whitehouse the first mate brought some of it on board, which tasted rather better than a
         turnep. My father returned on shore with him; for a few trifles obtained some large pieces
         of this root, and with some difficulty prevailed on two of the natives to accompany Mr.
         Whitehouse and him into the woods, in order to point out to them the species of plant to
         which the root belonged. They walked up a considerable way without any arms whatsoever,
         trusting to the honesty of their guides. These men pointed out a species of fern-tree,
         which they called mamaghoo, as having the eatable root; and at the same time shewed the
         difference between this, and another kind of fern-tree, which they named ponga. The first
         is full of a tender pulp or pith, which when cut exsudes a reddish juice of a gelatinous
         nature, nearly related to sago. This is so much the less singular, as the real sago-tree is
         a species of fern. The good nutritive root of the mamaghoo must not, however, be confounded
         with that wretched article of New Zeeland diet, the common fern-root, or acrostichum
         furcatum Linn. The latter consists of nothing but insipid sticks, which after being broiled
         over the fire for some time, are beaten or bruised on a stone with a piece of wood much
         resembling the Taheitian cloth-beater, but round instead of square, and without any
         grooves. The bruised mass is chewed, what little juice there may be in it sucked out, and
         the rest thrown aside. The mamaghoo on the contrary is tolerably good eating, and the only
         fault seems to be, that it is not plentiful enough for a constant supply. At their return
         they were witnesses of an instance of the ferocity of manners of this savage nation. A boy
         about six or seven years old demanded a piece of broiled pinguin, which his mother held in
         her hands. As she did not immediately comply with his demand, he took up a large stone and
         threw it at her. The woman incensed at this action ran to punish him, but she had scarcely
         given him a single blow, when her husband came forward, beat her unmercifully, and dashed
         her against the ground, for attempting to correct her unnatural child. Our people who were
         employed in filling water, told my father they had frequently seen similar instances of
         cruelty among them, and particularly, that the boys had actually struck their unhappy
         mother, whilst the father looked on lest she should attempt to retaliate. Among all savage
         nations the weaker sex is ill-treated, and the law of the strongest is put in force. Their
         women are mere drudges, who prepare raiment and provide dwellings, who cook and frequently
         collect their food, and are requited by blows and all kinds of severity. At New Zeeland it
         seems they carry this tyranny to excess, and the males are taught from their earliest age,
         to hold their mothers in contempt, contrary to all our principles of morality. I leave this
         barbarity without a comment, in order to relate the remaining occurrences of this day,
         which was pregnant in discoveries relative to the New Zeelanders. The captain, with Mr.
         Wales, and my father, went to Motu-Aro in the afternoon, where they looked after the
         plantations, collected greens for the ships, &amp;c. In the mean while some of the
         lieutenants went to the Indian Cove, with a view to trade with the natives. The first
         objects which struck them were the entrails of a human corse lying on a heap a few steps
         from the water. They were hardly recovered from their first surprize, when the natives
         shewed them several limbs of the body, and expressed by words and gestures that they had
         eaten the rest. The head without the lower jaw-bone, was one of the parts which remained,
         and from which it plainly appeared, that the deceased was a youth about fifteen or sixteen
         years old. The skull was fractured near one of the temples, as it seemed by the stroke of a
         pattoo-pattoo. This gave our officers an opportunity of enquiring how they came in
         possession of the body. The natives answered, that they had fought with their enemies, and
         had killed several of them, without being able to bring away any of the dead besides this
         youth. At the same time they acknowledged that they had lost some of their friends, and
         pointed to several women who were seated apart, weeping and cutting their foreheads with
         sharp stones, in commemoration of the dead. Our former conjectures were now amply verified,
         our apprehensions that we were the innocent causes of this disaster encreased, and the
         existence of anthropophagi confirmed by another strong proof. Mr. Pickersgill proposed to
         purchase the head, in order to preserve it till his return to England, where it might serve
         as a memorial of this voyage. He offered a nail, and immediately obtained the head for this
         price , after which he returned on board with his company, and placed it on the taffarel .
         We were all occupied in examining it, when some New Zeelanders came on board from the
         watering-place. At sight of the head they expressed an ardent desire of possessing it,
         signifying by the most intelligible gestures that it was delicious to the taste. Mr.
         Pickersgill refused to part with it, but agreed to cut off a small piece from the cheek,
         with which they seemed to be well satisfied. He cut off the part he had promised, and
         offered it to them, but they would not eat it raw, and made signs to have it dressed.
         Therefore, in presence of all the ship's company, it was broiled over the fire; after which
         they devoured it before our eyes with the greatest avidity. The captain arriving the moment
         after with his company, the New Zeelanders repeated the experiment once more in his
         presence. It operated very strangely and differently on the beholders. Some there were who,
         in spite of the abhorrence which our education inspires against the eating of human flesh,
         did not seem greatly disinclined to feast with them, and valued themselves on the
         brilliancy of their wit, while they compared their battle to a hunting-match. On the
         contrary, others were so unreasonably incensed against the perpetrators of this action,
         that they declared they could be well pleased to shoot them all; they were ready to become
         the most detestable butchers, in order to punish the imaginary crime of a people whom they
         had no right to condemn. A few other suffered the same effects as from a dose of
         ipecacuanha. The rest lamented this action as a brutal depravation of human nature,
         agreeably to the principles which they had imbibed. But the sensibility of Mahine, the
         young native of the Society Islands, shone out with superior lustre among us. Born and bred
         in a country where the inhabitants have already emerged from the darkness of barbarism, and
         are united by the bonds of society, this scene filled his mind with horror. He turned his
         eyes from the unnatural object, and retired into the cabin, to give vent to the emotions of
         his heart. There we found him bathed in tears; his looks were a mixture of compassion and
         grief, and as soon as he saw us, he expressed his concern for the unhappy parents of the
         victim. This turn which his reflections had taken, gave us infinite pleasure; it spoke a
         humane heart, filled with the warmest sentiments of social affection, and habituated to
         sympathize with its fellow-creatures. He was so deeply affected, that it was several hours
         before he could compose himself, and ever after, when he spoke on this subject, it was not
         without emotion. Philosophers, who have only contemplated mankind in their closets, have
         strenuously maintained, that all the assertions of authors, ancient and modern, of the
         existence of men-eaters are not to be credited; and there have not been wanting persons
         amongst ourselves who were sceptical enough to refuse belief to the concurrent testimonies
         in the history of almost all nations in this particular. But captain Cook had already, in
         his former voyage, received strong proof that the practice of eating human flesh existed in
         New Zeeland; and as now we have with our own eyes seen the inhabitants devouring human
         flesh, all controversy on that point must be at an end. The opinions of authors on the
         origin of this custom are infinitely various, and have lately been collected by the very
         learned canon Pauw, at Xanten, in his Recherches Philosophiques fur les Americains, vol. I.
         p. 207. He seems to think that men were first tempted to devour each other from real want
         of food and cruel necessity . Many weighty objections, however, may be made against this
         hypothesis; amongst which the following is one of the greatest. There are very few
         countries in the world so miserably barren as not to afford their inhabitants sufficient
         nourishment, and those, in particular, where anthropophagi still exist, do not come under
         that description. The northern isle of New Zeeland, on a coast of near four hundred
         leagues, contains scarcely one hundred thousand inhabitants, according to the most probable
         guess which can be made; a number inconsiderable for that vast space of country, even
         allowing the settlements to be confined only to the sea-shore. The great abundance of fish,
         and the beginnings of agriculture in the Bay of Plenty and other parts of the Northern
         Isle, are more than sufficient to maintain this number, because they have always had enough
         to supply strangers with what was deemed superfluous. It is true, before the dawn of the
         arts among them, before the invention of nets, and before the cultivation of potatoes, the
         means of subsistence may have been more difficult; but then the number of inhabitants must
         likewise have been infinitely smaller. Single instances are not conclusive in this case,
         though they prove how far the wants of the body may stimulate mankind to extraordinary
         actions. In 1772, during a famine which happened throughout all Germany, a herdsman was
         taken on the manor of Baron Boineburg, in Hessia, who had been urged by hunger to kill and
         devour a boy, and afterwards to make a practice of it for several months. From his
         confession it appeared, that he looked upon the flesh of young children as a very delicious
         food; and the gestures of the New Zeelanders indicated exactly the same thing. An old woman
         in the province of Matogrosso, in Brasil, declared to the Portuguese governor , that she
         had eaten human flesh several times, liked it very much, and should be very glad to feast
         upon it again, especially if it was part of a little boy. But it would be absurd to suppose
         from such circumstances, that killing men for the sake of feasting upon them, has ever been
         the spirit of a whole nation; because it is utterly incompatible with the existence of
         society. Slight causes have ever produced the most remarkable events among mankind, and the
         most trifling quarrels have fired their minds with incredible inveteracy against each
         other. Revenge has always been a strong passion among barbarians, who are less subject to
         the sway of reason than civilized people, and has stimulated them to a degree of madness
         which is capable of all kinds of excesses. The people who first consumed the body of their
         enemies, seem to have been bent upon exterminating their very inanimate remains, from an
         excess of passion; but, by degrees, finding the meat wholesome and palatable, it is not to
         be wondered that they should make a practice of eating their enemies as often as they
         killed any, since the action of eating human flesh, whatever our education may teach us to
         the contrary, is certainly neither unnatural nor criminal in itself. It can only become
         dangerous as far as it steels the mind against that compassionate fellow-feeling which is
         the great basis of civil society; and for this reason we find it naturally banished from
         every people as soon as civilization has made any progress among them. But though we are
         too much polished to be canibals, we do not find it unnaturally and savagely cruel to take
         the field, and to cut one another's throats by thousands, without a single motive, besides
         the ambition of a prince, or the caprice of his mistress! Is it not from prejudice that we
         are disgusted with the idea of eating a dead man, when we feel no remorse in depriving him
         of life? If the practice of eating human flesh makes men unfeeling and brutal, we have
         instances that civilized people, who would perhaps, like some of our sailors, have turned
         sick at the thought of eating human flesh, have committed barbarities without example
         amongst canibals. A New Zeelander, who kills and eats his enemy, is a very different being
         from an European, who, for his amusement, tears an infant from the mother's breast, in cool
         blood, and throws it on the earth to feed his hound </p>

      <p>The New Zeelanders never eat their adversaries, unless they are killed in battle; they
         never kill their relations for the purpose of eating them; they do not even eat them if
         they die of a natural death, and they take no prisoners with a view to fatten them for
         their repast ; though these circumstances have been related, with more or less truth of the
         American Indians. It is therefore not improbable, that in process of time they will
         entirely lay aside this custom; and the introduction of new domestic animals into their
         country might hasten that period, since greater affluence would tend to make them more
         sociable. Their religion does not seem likely to be an obstacle, because from what we could
         judge, they are not remarkably superstitious, and it is only among very bigoted nations,
         that the custom of offering human flesh to the gods, has prevailed after civilization.
         Tupaya , the only man who could freely converse with the New Zeelanders, soon learnt that
         they acknowledged a supreme Being; and this spark of divine revelation probably remains
         amongst all nations on the globe. To this they add the belief of some inferior divinities,
         so correspondent to those of the Taheitians, that their system of polytheism must be of
         very ancient date, and seems to derive its origin from their common ancestors. We never
         observed a single ceremony in New Zeeland, which could be supposed to have a religious
         tendency; and I know of only two circumstances which may be distantly construed to favour
         of superstition. The first is the name of atuee, " the bird of the divinity," which they
         sometimes give to a species of creeper (certhia cincinnata). This name seems to indicate a
         veneration like that which is paid to herons, and kingfishers at Taheitee, and the Society
         Isles; but I cannot say that they ever expressed the least wish to preserve the life of
         this bird in preference to the rest. The second, is the custom of wearing an amulet of
         green jadde on the breast, from a string round the neck. This piece of stone is of the size
         of two crown-pieces, and carved so as to bear a rude resemblance to a human being. These
         they call e-teeghee, a name which is doubtless equivalent to the Taheitian e-tee . In that
         island, and the adjacent group, e-tee signifies a wooden image of the human figure, erected
         on a pole at their cemeteries, in memory of the dead, but to which no worship nor
         particular respect is paid. The New Zeeland teeghee seems to be worn with a similar view,
         but not to be better respected; for though they did not part with it for a trifle, yet with
         half a yard of broad cloth or red kersey, which were our best goods in Queen Charlotte's
         Sound, we never failed to purchase it. Besides this, they often wear several rows of human
         teeth round the neck, but we understood that they were only the memorials of their prowess,
         since they had belonged to the enemies whom they had killed. It always appeared to us, that
         they have no priests or jugglers of any kind among them, which accounts for their having so
         little superstition. When the comforts of life are multiplied, it is possible that some
         individuals may be artful enough to improve upon their present ideas of religion, in order
         to enjoy exclusive advantages; for it has often been the fate of mankind, that the most
         sacred, and most inestimable gift of heaven, has served as a cloak under cover of which
         they have been deluded.</p>

      <p>Having fitted the ship to encounter the rigorous climate of the south, and received on
         board her provision of fresh water and wood, as well as the biscuit which had been baked
         over again, we re-imbarked all the tents from the <date>[Wednesd. 24.]</date>shore, and on
         the 24th, early in the morning, unmoored and rode by a single anchor. The natives
         immediately repaired to the beach which we had left, and finding there a heap of bread-dust
         which had been rejected as unfit for use at the revisal of our biscuit, they fell to, and
         consumed it all, though our hogs had before refused to touch it. We could not attribute
         this proceding to necessity, because they had plenty of fresh fish, of which they daily
         sold us enough for our consumption. It was rather owing to the diversity of their taste
         from ours, or to the natural inclination for variety, which made them eat the worst of
         vegetable food, because it was a rarity, in preference to fish, which is their constant
         diet. They had another motive for visiting the place of our late establishment; this was,
         to pick up any little trifles, such as nails, rags, &amp;c. which we might have left
         behind. Whilst they were so employed, some others came from the interior parts of the bay,
         and offered a great quantity of their tools and weapons to sell.</p>

      <p>In the afternoon, a boat was sent on shore to bury a bottle at the foot of a tree, with a
         letter for captain Furneaux, in case he should come into the harbour after our departure.
         Another boat, with several officers, and my father, went to Indian Cove, where the entrails
         of the body still lay on the ground. The war-canoe, in which the expedition had been made,
         had a carved head ornamented with bunches of brown feathers, and a double-forked prong
         projected from it, on which the heart of their slain enemy was tranfixed. Our gentlemen
         purchased a quantity of their prepared hemp or flax, and many fish-hooks, armed with bone,
         which, according to the account of the natives, was taken from the human arm.</p>

      <p><date>[Thursday 25.]</date>At four o'clock the next morning, a boat was sent to the
         Motu-Aro, in order to take a few cabbages out of our plantations. My father took that
         opportunity of searching the shore for the last time, and was fortunate enough to find some
         plants which we had not seen before. In the mean while we hove the anchor, set sail, and
         took up the boat on our way; but finding the current and wind against us, we were forced to
         come to again about seven o'clock, between Motu-Aro and Long Island. Here we lay an hour or
         two, and then set sail with a more favourable breeze, which carried us into Cook's
         Strait.</p>

      <p>We stood close in shore under cape Tera-Wittee, and fired several guns to give the
         Adventure notice of our approach, in case she had lain in one of the adjacent harbours.
         Between the Capes Tera-Wittee and Palliser, we discovered a very deep bay, of which the
         shores had every where a gentle slope, and especially towards the bottom, where the hills
         were removed to such a distance, that we could but just discern them. If there is a
         sufficient depth of water for ships in this bay, and of that we had no room to doubt, it
         appears to be a most convenient spot for an European settlement. There is a great stretch
         of land fit for cultivation, and easily defensible; there is likewise plenty of wood, and
         almost certain indications of a considerable river; and lastly, the country does not seem
         to be very populous, so that there would be little danger of quarrels with the natives;
         advantages which are not frequently to be met with jointly in many spots of New Zeeland.
         The flag (phormium tenax) of which the natives make all their clothes, mats, ropes, and
         nets, affords such an excellent kind of flax, which is at once glossy, elastic, and strong,
         that it might become an article of commerce in India, where cordage and canvas is wanted.
         Perhaps in future ages, when the maritime powers of Europe lose their American colonies,
         they may think of making new establishments in more distant regions; and if it were ever
         possible for Europeans to have humanity enough to acknowledge the indigenous tribes of the
         South Sea as their brethren, we might have settlements which would not be defiled with the
         blood of innocent nations.</p>

      <p>We continued firing guns as we stood past this bay, and <date>[Friday 26.]</date>the next
         morning having doubled Cape Palliser, we ran along the coast to the northward till the
         evening, likewise firing guns from time to time. Our attempts to rejoin our consort were to
         no purpose; we heard no answer to all our signals, though we hearkened with an attention,
         and an eagerness which plainly shewed how unwillingly we ventured on a second cruize among
         numberless dangers without a companion. We were forced at last to give up the thought of
         seeing her again, and about six o'clock took our departure from Cape Palliser, steering to
         the S. S. E.</p>

      <p>The scurvy, which had afflicted some of our people after the first tedious cruize to the
         south, between the Cape of Good Hope and Dusky Bay, had been entirely subdued by the
         wholesome diet on fish, and the drinking of spruce-beer in that harbour; and afterwards by
         the excellent greens in Queen Charlotte's Sound. Our disagreeable passage in winter from
         New Zeeland to Taheitee, had revived the symptoms of the disease in many persons, and in
         some to a considerable degree; but the continual supply of fresh vegetables, which we
         received at that island, together with the provision of excellent pork at the Society and
         Friendly Isles, had entirely re-established them. Our second stay at Queen's Charlotte's
         Sound had likewise furnished us, as before, with abundance of celery and scurvy-grass,
         which counteracted the noxious effects of salted meat; so that we were, to appearance, in a
         good state of health at our second departure from thence. It may, however, justly be
         questioned, whether the continual hardships and labours which we had undergone, had not in
         reality made the shew of health deceitful, and impaired the body so much that it was not
         able to resist so long as it had formerly done. The officers and passengers entered upon
         this second cruize under several difficulties which did not exist before. They had now no
         live-stock to be compared to that which they took from the Cape of Good Hope; and the
         little store of provisions which had supplied their table with variety in preference to
         that of the common sailor, was now so far consumed, that they were nearly upon a level,
         especially as the seamen were inured to that way of life by constant habit almost from
         their infancy; and the others had never experienced it before. The hope of meeting with new
         lands was vanished, the topics of common conversation were exhausted, the cruize to the
         south could not present any thing new, but appeared in all its chilling horrors before us,
         and the absence of our consort doubled every danger. We had enjoyed a few agreeable days
         between the tropics, we had feasted as well as the produce of various islands would permit,
         and we had been entertained with the novelty of many objects among different nations; but,
         according to the common vicissitudes of fortune, this agreeable moment was to be replaced
         by a long period of fogs and frosty weather, of fasting, and of tedious uniformity. The
         late Abbé Chappe, in his voyage to California, (or his compiler, M. Cassini, in his name),
         observes , " that variety alone has charms for the traveller, who goes in quest of her from
         one country to another." His philosophy is at the same time of such an exalted nature, that
         he pronounces " the life which is led at sea to be tedious and uniform only to those who
         are not accustomed to look round them, and who behold all nature with the eye of
         indifference." Had the good Abbé been unfortunate enough to make a visit to the antarctic
         circle, without the company of several hundred fattened fowls, which kept him in good
         humour on his short trip from Cadiz to Vera Cruz, his philosophy would not have taken so
         high a flight. But though he found variety at sea, he was not so fortunate in Mexico . Here
         he crossed great tracts of uncultivated country and extensive forests, he saw nature in a
         savage state, allowed that she was rich and beautiful; but, in the space of a few days, her
         multiplicity of charms became insipid and uniform in his eyes. And yet this traveller
         assures us, that he was astronomer, botanist, zoologist, mineralogist, chymist, and
         philosopher!</p>

      <p>We quitted the shores of New Zeeland with ideas very different from those of Abbé Chappe;
         and if any thing alleviated the dreariness of the prospect with a great part of our
         ship-mates, it was the hope of completing the circle round the South-Pole in a high
         latitude during the next inhospitable summer, and of returning to England within the space
         of eight months. This hope contributed to animate the spirits of our people during the
         greatest part of our continuance in bad weather; but in the end it vanished like a dream,
         and the only thought which could make them amends, was the certainty of passing another
         season among the happy islands in the torrid zone.</p>

      <head>CHAP. III.</head>

      <p><date>[1773. november.][Saturday 27.]</date>THE morning after we had taken our departure,
         we had a N. N. W. wind, which raised the thermometer to 64 deg. The two next days it stood
         at 54 deg. then at 48; and when we were in about 49° of south latitude, at 44 1/2 deg. On
         the 28th of November, we observed a number of seals, or perhaps sea-lions, passing by us at
         a distance towards the land which we had left. From that time <date>[1773. December][Monday
            6.]</date>to the 6th of December we daily saw great flocks of blue and other petrels,
         together with the different species of albatrosses, the skuas or grey gulls, many pinguins,
         and abundance of sea-weed. About seven in the evening, on that day, we were in the latitude
         of 51° 33' south, and long. 180°; consequently just at the point of the antipodes of
         London. The remembrance of domestic felicity, and of the sweets of society, called forth a
         sigh from every heart which felt the tender ties of filial or parental affection. We are
         the first Europeans, and I believe I may add, the first human beings, who have reached this
         point, where it is probable none will come after us. A common report prevails indeed in
         England concerning Sir Francis Drake, who is said to have visited the antipodes, which the
         legend expresses by " his having passed under the middle arch of London-bridge:" but this
         is a mistake, as his track lay along the coast of America, and probably originates from his
         having passed the periœci, or the point in 180° long. on the same circle of north latitude,
         on the coast of California.</p>

      <p>In proportion as we advanced to the southward the thermometer <date>[Friday
         10.]</date>fell; and on the 10th, in the morning, the wind coming more ahead, it descended
         to 37°. At noon we had reached the latitude of 59° south, without having met with any ice,
         though we fell in with it the preceding year on the 10th of December, between the 50th and
         51st deg. of south latitude. It is difficult to account for this difference; perhaps a
         severe winter preceding our first course from the Cape of Good Hope, might accumulate more
         ice that year than the next, which is the more probable, as we learnt at the Cape that the
         winter had been sharper there than usual; perhaps a violent storm might break the polar
         ice, and drive it so far to the northward as we found it; and perhaps both these causes
         might concur, with others, to produce this effect.</p>

      <p>On the 11th, at night, the cold encreased, the thermometer standing at 34 deg. and at four
         o'clock the next <date>[Sunday 12.]</date>morning a large island of floating ice was seen
         ahead, which we passed an hour afterwards. At eight o'clock the thermometer was already at
         31 1/2 deg. the air being probably refrigerated by the ice, though we did not see more than
         this one piece. At noon we found the latitude to be 61° 46' south. The next morning the
         thermometer stood at 31 deg. and we ran to the eastward with a fresh breeze, though we had
         a surprising fall of snow, which filled the air to such a degree that we could not see ten
         yards before us. Our friend Mahine had already expressed his surprize at several little
         snow and hail showers on the preceding days, this phӕnomenon being utterly unknown in his
         country. The appearance of " white stones," which melted in his hand, was altogether
         miraculous in his eyes, and though we endeavoured to explain to him that cold was the cause
         of their formation, yet I believe his ideas on that subject were never very clear. The
         heavy fall of snow this day surprised him more than what he had seen before, and after a
         long consideration of its singular qualities, he told us he would call it the white rain
         when he came back to his country. He did not see the first ice on account of the early hour
         of the morning; but two days after, in about 65 deg. of south latitude, he was struck with
         astonishment upon seeing one of the largest pieces, and the day following presented him
         with an extensive field of ice, which blocked up our farther progress to the south, and
         gave him great pleasure, supposing it to be land. We told him that so far from being land,
         it was nothing but fresh water, which we found some difficulty to convince him off at
         first, till we shewed him the ice which was formed in the scuttled cask on the deck. He
         assured us, however, that he would at all events call this the white land, by way of
         distinguishing it from all the rest. Already, at New Zeeland, he had collected a number of
         little slender twigs, which he carefully tied in a bundle, and made use of instead of
         journals. For every island which he had seen and visited, after his departure from the
         Society Isles, he had selected a little twig; so that his collection amounted at present to
         nine or ten, of which he remembered the names perfectly well in the same order as we had
         seen them, and the white land, or whennua tèatèa, was the last. He enquired frequently how
         many other countries we should meet with in our way to England, and formed a separate
         bundle of them, which he studied every day with equal care as the first. The tediousness of
         this part of our voyage probably made him so eager to know how it would end; and the salt
         provisions, together with the cold climate, contributed to disgust him. His usual amusement
         was to separate the red feathers from the aprons, used in dancing, which he had purchased
         at Tonga-Tabboo, and to join eight or ten of them together into a little tuft, by means of
         coco-nut core. The rest of his time he passed in walking on deck, visiting the officers and
         petty officers, and warming himself by the fire in the captain's cabin. We took this
         opportunity to improve in the knowledge of his language, and, by degrees, revised the whole
         vocabulary which we had collected at the Society Isles. By this method we became possessed
         of a fund of useful intelligence concerning his country and the adjacent isles, which led
         us to make many enquiries at our subsequent return to those islands.</p>

      <p>The ice-fields appeared, in different parts of the horizon, about us on the 15th in the
         morning, so that we were in a manner embayed; and, as we saw no possibility of advancing to
         the south, we ran to the N. N. E. to get clear of them. The weather, which was already
         foggy, became thicker towards noon, and made our situation, amidst a great number of
         floating rocks of ice, extremely dangerous. About one o'clock, whilst the people were at
         dinner, we were alarmed by the sudden appearance of a large island of ice just a head of
         us. It was absolutely impossible either to wear or tack the ship , on account of its
         proximity, and our only resource was to keep as near the wind as possible, and to try to
         weather the danger. We were in the most dreadful suspense for a few minutes, and though we
         fortunately succeeded, yet the ship passed within her own length to windward of it.
         Notwithstanding the constant perils to which our course exposed us in this unexplored
         ocean, our ship's company were far from being so uneasy as might have been expected; and,
         as in battle the sight of death becomes familiar and often unaffecting, so here, by daily
         experiencing such hair-breadth escapes, we passed unconcernedly on, as if the waves, the
         winds, and rocks of ice had not the power to hurt us. The pieces of ice had a variety of
         shapes, in the same manner as those which we had observed to the southward of the Indian
         Ocean; and many pyramids, obelisks, and church-spires appeared from time to time. Their
         height was not much inferior to that which we had observed among the first islands of ice
         in 1772; and many likewise resembled them in being of a great extent and perfectly level at
         top.</p>

      <p>The number of birds which we had hitherto met with on our passage, would have persuaded any
         other voyagers but ourselves of the approach of land. We were, however, so much used to
         their appearance on the sea at present, as never once to form any expectation of
         discovering land from that circumstance. Flocks of blue petrels and pintadas, many
         albatrosses, with now and then a solitary skua had attended us every day; and to these,
         since our approach to the ice, we could join the snowy and antarctic petrels and the
         fulmars. However, pinguins, sea-weed, or seals, had not been observed since the 10th.</p>

      <p>The weather, which was extremely moist and disagreeably cold, proved unfavourable to the
         doves and pigeons which many people had purchased at the Society and Friendly Islands, and
         to the singing-birds which they had been at great pains to catch alive at New Zeeland. We
         had five doves at our departure from this country, all which died one after another before
         the 16th of December, being much more exposed to the cold in our cabins, than in the
         sailors births. The thermometer in our cabins was never more than 5 deg. higher than in the
         open air on deck, and their situation abreast of the main-mast, where the strain of the
         ship is greatest, exposed them to currents of air, and made them admit water like
         sieves.</p>

      <p>On the 16th, in the afternoon, and on the 17th, we <date>[Friday 17.]</date>hoisted out our
         boats and collected some loose pieces of ice to fill our empty casks with fresh water. The
         ice which we picked up was old and spungy, and impregnated with saline particles, from
         having long been in a state of decay; therefore did not afford us very good water, but it
         was drinkable, particularly if we let the pieces of ice lie on deck for some time, by which
         means the salt-water was almost entirely drained off. From this time till the 20th we saw
         no birds about us, which disappeared without any visible cause; but on that day some
         albatrosses appeared again.</p>

      <p>Having left the ice behind which obstructed our passage, we had gradually advanced to the
         southward again, that being our principal object, and on the <date>[Monday 20.]</date>20th
         in the afternoon, we crossed the antarctic circle the second time during our voyage. The
         weather was wet and foggy, ice islands were numerous around us, and the gale was very
         brisk. Many antarctic petrels, and a whale which spouted up the water near us, seemed to
         indicate our entrance into the frigid zone. At night two seals appeared, which we had not
         seen for fourteen days past, and gave some faint hopes of seeing land to several of our
         shipmates; but our course disappointed their expectations, by continuing within the circle
         as far as 67° 12' S. lat. for several days following.</p>

      <p><date>[Thursday 23.]</date>On the 23d in the afternoon, we were surrounded with islands of
         ice, and the sea was in a manner covered with small fragments. The ship was therefore
         brought to, the boats hoisted out, and a great quantity of good ice taken on board. The
         birds were at present very numerous about us again, and some antarctic and other petrels
         were shot and taken up, which we had an opportunity of drawing and describing. About this
         time many persons were afflicted with violent rheumatic pains, head-aches, swelled glands,
         and catarrhal fevers, which some attributed to the use of ice-water. My father, who had
         complained of a cold for several days past, was obliged to keep his bed today, having a
         severe rheumatism with a fever. His complaint seemed rather to arise from the wretched
         accommodations which he had on board, every thing in his cabin rotting in the wet which it
         admitted, and being mouldy. The cold was so sensible there this day in particular, that he
         found only a difference of two degrees and a half between the thermometer there, and that
         upon the deck.</p>

      <p>After hoisting in our boats we made sail to the northward, as much as a contrary wind
         permitted, during all the night and the next day. <date>[Saturday 25.]</date>On the 25th,
         the weather was clear and fair, but the wind died away to a perfect calm, upwards of ninety
         large ice islands being in sight at noon. This being Christmas-day, the captain according
         to custom, invited the officers and mates to dinner, and one of the lieutenant's
         entertained the petty-officers. The sailors feasted on a double portion of pudding,
         regaling themselves with the brandy of their allowance, which they had saved for this
         occasion some months before-hand, being sollicitous to get very drunk, though they are
         commonly sollicitous about nothing else. The sight of an immense number of icy masses,
         amongst which we drifted at the mercy of the current, every moment in danger of being
         dashed to pieces against them, could not deter the sailors from indulging in their
         favourite amusement. As long as they had brandy left, they would persist to keep Christmas
         " like Christians," though the elements had conspired together for their destruction. Their
         long acquaintance with a sea-faring life had inured them to all kinds of perils, and their
         heavy labour, with the inclemencies of weather, and other hardships, making their muscles
         rigid and their nerves obtuse, had communicated insensibility to the mind. It will easily
         be conceived, that as they do not feel for themselves sufficiently to provide for their own
         safety, they must be incapable of feeling for others. Subjected to a very strict command,
         they also exercise a tyrannical sway over those whom fortune places in their power.
         Accustomed to face an enemy, they breathe nothing but war. By force of habit even killing
         is become so much their passion, that we have seen many instances during our voyage, where
         they have expressed a horrid eagerness to fire upon the natives on the slightest pretences.
         Their way of life in general prevents their enjoying domestic comforts; and gross animal
         appetites fill the place of purer affections.</p>

      <p>Though they are members of a civilized society, they may in some measure be looked upon as
         a body of uncivilized men, rough, passionate, revengeful, but likewise brave, sincere, and
         true to each other.</p>

      <p>At noon the observation of the sun's altitude determined our latitude to be 66° 22' south,
         so that we were just returned out of the antarctic circle. We had scarcely any night during
         our stay in the frigid zone, so that I find several articles in my father's journal,
         written by the light of the sun, within a few minutes before the hour of midnight. The
         sun's stay below the horizon was so very short this night likewise, that we had a very
         strong twilight all the time. Mahine was struck with the greatest astonishment at this
         phӕnomenon, and would scarcely believe his senses. All our endeavours to explain it to him
         miscarried, and he assured us he despaired of finding belief among his countrymen, when he
         should come back to recount the wonders of petrified rain, and of perpetual day. The first
         Venetians who explored the northern extremes of the European continent, were equally
         surprised at the continual appearance of the sun above the horizon, and relate that they
         could only distinguish day from night, by the instinct of the sea-fowl, which went to roost
         on shore, for the space of four hours . As we were in all likelihood far distant from any
         land, this indication failed us, and we have often observed numerous birds on the wing
         about us all the night, and particularly great flocks of different species, so late as
         eleven o'clock.</p>

      <p>At six in the evening, we counted one hundred and five large masses of ice around us from
         the deck, the weather continuing very clear, fair, and perfectly calm. Towards noon
            <date>[Sunday 26.]</date>the next day we were still in the same situation, with a very
         drunken crew, and from the mast-head observed one hundred and sixty-eight ice islands, some
         of which were half a mile long, and none less than the hull of the ship. The whole scene
         looked like the wrecks of a shattered world, or as the poets describe some regions of hell;
         an idea which struck us the more forcibly, as execrations, oaths, and curses re-echoed
         about us on all sides.</p>

      <p><date>[Monday 27.]</date>A faint breeze sprung up in the afternoon, with which we made slow
         advances to the northward, the number of ice islands decreasing in proportion as we receded
         from the antarctic circle. About four the next morning, we hoisted out our boats, and took
         in a fresh provision of ice. The weather changed soon after, the wind coming about to the
         north-eastward, which brought on much snow and sleet. My father, and twelve other persons
         were again much afflicted with rheumatic pains, and confined to their beds. The scurvy did
         not yet appear under any dangerous form in the ship, and all those who had any slight
         symptoms of it, amongst whom I was one, drank plentifully of the fresh wort, quite warm,
         twice a day, and abstained as much as possible from salt-diet. A general languor and sickly
         look however, manifested itself in almost every person's face, which threatened us with
         more dangerous consequences. Captain Cook himself was likewise pale and lean, entirely lost
         his appetite, and laboured under a perpetual costiveness. </p>

      <p><date>[1774. January.][Saturday 1.]</date>We advanced to the northward as much as the winds
         would permit us, and lost sight of the ice on the first of January 1774, in 59° 7' S.
         latitude. <date>[Tuesday 4.]</date>On the 4th, the wind blowing from the westward was very
         boisterous, and obliged us to keep all our sails double-reefed; the sea ran high, and the
         ship worked very heavily, rolling violently from side to side. This continued till the 6th
         at noon, <date>[Thursday 6.]</date>when, having reached 51° of S.latitude, we bore away
         from the wind, to the N. N. E. We were now within a few degrees of the track which we had
         made in June and July last, in going from New Zeeland to Taheitee, and had directed our
         course towards it, in order to leave no considerable part of this great ocean unexplored.
         As far as we had hitherto advanced, we had found no land, not even indications of land; our
         first track had crossed the South Sea in the middle latitudes, or between 40 and 50
         degrees. In our course till Christmas, we had explored the greatest part of it between 60
         degrees and the antarctic circle; and the present course to the northward had crossed the
         space between the two former runs. If any land has escaped us, it must be an island, whose
         distance from Europe, and situation in an uncouth climate cannot make it valuable to this
         country. It is obvious that to search a sea of such extent as the South Sea, in order to be
         certain of the existence, or non-existence of a small island, would require many voyages in
         numberless different tracks, and cannot be effected in a single expedition. But it is
         sufficient for us, to have proved that no large land or continent exists in the South Sea
         within the temperate zone, and that if it exists at all, we have at least confined it
         within the antarctic circle.</p>

      <p>The long continuance in these cold climates began now to hang heavily on our crew,
         especially as it banished all hope of returning home this year, which had hitherto
         supported their spirits. At first a painful despondence, owing to the dreary prospect of
         another year's cruize to the South, seemed painted in every countenance; till by degrees
         they resigned themselves to their fate, with a kind of sullen indifference. It must be
         owned however, that nothing could be more dejecting than the entire ignorance of our future
         destination, which, without any apparent reason, was constantly kept a secret to every
         person in the ship.</p>

      <p>We now stood to the north-eastward for a few days, till we came so far as 47° 52' south
         latitude, where the thermometer rose to 52 degrees. On that day, which was the 11th,
            <date>[Monday 11.]</date>at noon, the course was directed to the S. E. again, though
         this frequent and sudden change of climate could not fail of proving very hurtful to our
         health in general. <date>[Saturday 15.]</date>On the 15th the wind encreased very much, and
         in a short time blew a tempestuous gale, which took.</p>

      <p>A nine o'clock a huge mountainous wave struck the ship on the beam, and filled the decks
         with a deluge of water. It poured through the sky-light over our heads, and extinguished
         the candle, leaving us for a moment in doubt, whether we were not entirely overwhelmed and
         sinking into the abyss. Every thing was afloat in my father's cabin, and his bed was
         thoroughly soaked. His rheumatism, which had now afflicted him above a fortnight, was still
         so violent as to have almost deprived him of the use of his legs, and his pains redoubled
         in the morning. <date>[Sunday 16.]</date>Our situation at present was indeed very dismal,
         even to those who preserved the blessing of health; to the sick, whose crippled limbs were
         tortured with excessive pain, it was insupportable. The ocean about us had a furious
         aspect, and seemed incensed at the presumption of a few intruding mortals. A gloomy
         melancholy air loured on the brows of our shipmates, and a dreadful silence reigned amongst
         us. Salt meat, our constant diet, was become loathsome to all, and even to those who had
         been bred to a nautical life from their tender years: the hour of dinner was hateful to us,
         for the well known smell of the victuals had no sooner reached our nose, than we found it
         impossible to partake of them with a hearty appetite.</p>

      <p>It will appear from hence that this voyage was not to be compared to any preceding one, for
         the multitude of hardships and distresses which attended it. Our predecessors in the South
         Sea had always navigated within the tropic, or at least in the best parts of the temperate
         zone; they had almost constantly enjoyed mild easy weather, and sailed in sight of lands,
         which were never so wretchedly destitute as not to afford them refreshments from time to
         time. Such a voyage would have been merely a party of pleasure to us; continually
         entertained with new and often agreeable objects, our minds would have been at ease, our
         conversation cheerful, our bodies healthy, and our whole situation desirable and happy.
         Ours was just the reverse of this; our southern cruizes were uniform and tedious in the
         highest degree; the ice, the fogs, the storms and ruffled surface of the sea formed a
         disagreeable scene, which was seldom cheered by the reviving beams of the sun; the climate
         was rigorous and our food detestable. In short, we rather vegetated than lived; we
         withered, and became indifferent to all that animates the soul at other times. We
         sacrificed our health, our feelings, our enjoyments, to the honour of pursuing a track
         unattempted before. This was indeed as the poet says.</p>

      <p>The crew were as much distressed as the officers, from another cause. Their biscuit, which
         had been sorted at New Zeeland, baked over again, and then packed up, was now in the same
         decayed state as before. This was owing partly to the revisal, which had been so rigorous,
         that many a bad biscuit was preserved among those that were eatable, and partly to the
         neglect of the casks, which had not been sufficiently fumigated and dried. Of this rotten
         bread the people only received two thirds of their usual allowance, from œconomical
         principles; but, as that portion is hardly sufficient, supposing it to be all eatable, it
         was far from being so when nearly one half of it was rotten. However, they continued in
         that distressful situation till this day, when the first mate came to the captain and
         complained bitterly that he and the people had not wherewith to satisfy the cravings of the
         stomach, producing, at the same time, the rotten and stinking remains of his biscuit. Upon
         this the crew were put to full allowance. The captain seemed to recover again as we
         advanced to the southward, but all those who were afflicted with rheumatisms continued as
         much indisposed as ever.</p>

      <p><date>[Thursday 20.]</date>The first ice islands which we met with on this run were in 62°
         30' south, on the 20th, but they did not accumulate in number in proportion to our
         progress, so that we <date>[Wednesd. 26.]</date>crossed the antarctic circle again on the
         26th, without seeing more than a few solitary pieces. On that day we were amused with the
         appearance of land; for after standing on towards it for some hours, it vanished in clouds.
            <date>[Thursday 27.]</date>The next day, at noon, we were in 67° 52' south; consequently
         to the southward of any of our former tracks, and met with no ice to stop us. The blue
         petrels, the little storm petrels, and the pintadas still accompanied us, but albatrosses
         had left us some time ago. We were now once more in the regions of perpetual day , and had
         sunshine at the hour of midnight.</p>

      <p><date>[Friday 28.]</date>On the 28th, in the afternoon, we passed a large bed of broken
         ice, hoisted out the boats, and took up a great quantity, which afforded a seasonable
         supply of fresh water. At midnight the thermometer was not lower than 34°, and the next
         morning we enjoyed the mildest sunshine we had ever experienced in the frigid zone. My
         father therefore ventured upon deck for the first time after a month's confinement.</p>

      <p>We now entertained hopes of penetrating to the south as far as other navigators have done
         towards the north pole; but on the 30th, about seven o'clock in the morning, we discovered
         a solid ice-field of immense extent before us, which bore from E. to W. A bed of fragments
         floated all round this field, which seemed to be raised several feet high above the level
         of the water. A vast number of icy masses, some of a very great height, were irregularly
         piled up upon it, as far as the eye could reach. Our latitude was at this time 71° 10'
         south, consequently less than 19 deg. from the pole; but as it was impossible to proceed
         farther, we put the ship about, well satisfied with our perilous expedition, and almost
         persuaded that no navigator will care to come after, and much less attempt to pass beyond
         us. Our longitude at this time was nearly 106° W. The thermometer here was at 32°, and a
         great many pinguins were heard croaking round us, but could not be seen on account of the
         foggy weather which immediately succeeded.</p>

      <p>As often as we had hitherto penetrated to the southward, we had met with no land, but been
         stopped sooner or later by a solid ice-field, which extended before us as far as we could
         see. At the same time we had always found the winds moderate and frequently easterly in
         these high latitudes, in the same manner as they are said to be in the northern frozen
         zone. From these circumstances my father had been led to suppose, that all the south pole,
         to the distance of 20 degrees, more or less, is covered with solid ice, of which only the
         extremities are annually broken by storms, consumed by the action of the sun, and
         regenerated in winter.</p>

      <p>This opinion is the less exceptionable, since there seems to be no absolute necessity for
         the existence of land towards the formation of ice , and because we have little reason to
         suppose that there actually is any land of considerable extent in the frigid zone.</p>

      <p><date>[1774. February.][Saturday 5.]</date>We ran to the northward with moderate winds till
         the 5th of February, when we got a fine fresh breeze after a short calm. The day after it
         shifted to S. E. and freshened so as to blow very hard at night, and split several sails.
         As it was favourable for the purpose of advancing to the northward, the only circumstance
         that afforded us comfort, we were far from being concerned at its violence, and in
            <date>[Tuesday 8.]</date>the next twenty-four hours made upwards of three degrees of
         latitude. The same gale assisted us till the 12th, when we observed the latitude to be 50°
         15' south, our thermometer being once more returned to the milder temperature of 48
         degrees. We were now told that we should spend the winter season, which was coming on
         apace, among the tropical islands of the Pacific Ocean, in the same manner as we had passed
         that immediately preceding. The prospect of making new discoveries, and of enjoying the
         excellent refreshments which those islands afford, entirely revived our hopes, and made us
         look on our continuance on the western side of Cape Horne with some degree of
         satisfaction.</p>

      <p>A great number of our people were however afflicted with very severe rheumatic pains, which
         deprived them of the use of their limbs; but their spirits were so low, that they had no
         fever. Though the use of that excellent prophylactic the sour krout, prevented the
         appearance of the scurvy during all the cold weather, yet being made of cabbage, it is not
         so nutritive that we could live upon it without the assistance of biscuit and salt-beef.
         But the former of these being rotten, and the other almost consumed by the salt, it is
         obvious that no wholesome juices could be secreted from thence, which might have kept the
         body strong and vigorous. Under these difficulties all our patients recovered very slowly,
         having nothing to restore their strength; and my father, who had been in exquisite torments
         during the greatest part of our southern cruize, was afflicted with tooth-aches, swelled
         cheeks, sore-throat, and universal pain till the middle of February, when he ventured on
         deck perfectly emaciated. The warm weather which was beneficial to him, proved fatal to
         captain Cook's constitution. The disappearance of his bilious complaint during our last
         push to the south, had not been so sincere, as to make him recover his appetite. The return
         to the north therefore brought on a dangerous obstruction, which the captain very
         unfortunately slighted, and concealed from every person in the ship, at the same time
         endeavouring to get the better of it by taking hardly any sustenance. This proceeding,
         instead of removing, encreased the evil, his stomach being already weak enough before. He
         was afflicted with violent pains, which in the space of a few days confined him to his bed,
         and forced him to have recourse to medicines. He took a purge, but instead of producing the
         desired effect, it caused a violent vomiting, which was assisted immediately by proper
         emetics. All attempts however to procure a passage through his bowels were ineffectual; his
         food and medicines were thrown up, and in a few days a most dreadful hiccough appeared,
         which lasted for upwards of twenty-four hours, with such astonishing violence that his life
         was entirely despaired of. Opiates and glysters had no effect, till repeated hot baths, and
         plasters of theriaca applied on his stomach, had relaxed his body and intestines. This
         however, was not effected till he had lain above a week in the most imminent danger. Our
         servant fell ill about the same time with the captain, of the same disorder, and narrowly
         escaped, but continued weak and unserviceable the greatest part of our cruize between the
         tropics.</p>

      <p>During this time we advanced to the northward very <date>[Tuesday 22.]</date>fast, so that
         on the 22d we reached 36° 10 S. latitude, where the albatrosses left us. Our longitude
         being about 94 1/2 degrees west from Greenwich, we steered to the south-westward, in quest
         of a supposed discovery of Juan Fernandez, which, according to Juan Luis Arias, a Spanish
         author, is said to lie in 40° south latitude, and by Mr. Dalrymple's chart in 90° west from
         London . We stood <date>[Friday 25.]</date>on to the westward till the 25th at noon, where
         being in 37° 50' S. and about 101° W. and seeing no signs of land, we altered our course
         something to the northward. The dangerous situation of captain Cook, was perhaps the
         reason, why our track was not continued farther to the south, so as to put this matter
         entirely out of doubt for the future. It was indeed of the utmost importance at present, to
         hasten to a place of refreshment, that being the only chance to preserve his life.</p>

      <p>On the 26th, captain Cook felt some relief from the medicines which had been administered
         to him, and during the three following days, recovered so far as to be able to sit up
         sometimes, and take a little soup. Next to Providence it was chiefly owing to the skill of
         our surgeon, Mr. Patton, that he recovered to prosecute the remaining part of our voyage,
         with the same spirit with which it had hitherto been carried on. The care and assiduity
         with which this worthy man, watched him during his whole illness, cannot be sufficiently
         extolled, as all our hopes of future discoveries, as well as union in the ship, depended
         solely on the preservation of the captain. The surgeon's extreme attention however, had
         nearly cost him his own life. Having taken, no rest for many nights together, and seldom
         venturing to sleep an hour by day, he was so much exhausted, that we trembled for his life,
         upon which that of almost every man in the ship in great measure depended. He was taken ill
         with a bilious disorder, which was dangerous on account of the extreme weakness of his
         stomach, and it is more than probable, that if we had not speedily fallen in with land,
         from whence we collected some slight refreshments, he must have fallen a sacrifice to that
         rigorous perseverance and extreme punctuality with which he discharged the several duties
         of his profession.</p>

      <p>We had easterly winds ever since the 22d of February, which was probably owing to the
         situation of the sun, still continuing in the southern hemisphere. The weather was warm and
         comfortable again, the thermometer being at 70 degrees; and some grey terns were seen from
         time to time, which according to our friend Mahine's account, never went to a great
         distance from land. <date>[1774. March.][Tuesday 1.]</date>On the first of March, some
         bonitos appeared swiftly swimming past the ship, and the next day, being in 30 1/2 degrees
         of latitude, we saw tropic birds again.</p>

      <p>The scurvy now appeared with very strong symptoms in the ship, and I was particularly
         afflicted with it. Excruciating pains, livid blotches, rotten gums, and swelled legs,
         brought me extremely low in a few days, almost before I was aware of the disorder; and my
         stomach being very weak, through abstinence from an unwholesome and loathed diet, I could
         not take the wort in sufficient quantity to remove my complaint. The same case existed with
         regard to a number of other people, who crawled about the decks with the greatest
         difficulty.</p>

      <p>We had almost calm weather from the 3d to the 6th, the sky was clear, and the warmth and
         serenity of the weather remarkably pleasing; but we were impatient to proceed to a place of
         refreshment, and this delay ill suited with our wishes.</p>

      <p>On the 5th, at night, we saw some towering clouds and a haze on the horizon to the
         southward, from whence we hoped for a fair wind. Already, during night, we had some smart
         showers, and at eight o'clock the next morning we saw the surface of the sea curled to the
         south-eastward, upon which we trimmed our sails, and advanced again with a fair wind.
            <date>[Monday 7.]</date>The next morning four large albecores were caught, the least of
         which weighed twenty-three pounds. They afforded us a most delicious repast, it being now
         an hundred days since we had tasted any fresh fish. Shearwaters, terns, noddies, gannets,
         and men of war birds appeared numerous about us, hunting the shoals of flying-fish which
         our ship, the bonitos, albecores, and dolphins had frightened out of the water.</p>

      <p><date>[Tuesday 8.]</date>We reached the 27th degree of S. latitude on the 8th at noon, and
         then shaped our course due west in search of Easter Island, discovered by Jacob Roggewein
         in 1722, and since visited by the Spaniards in 1770 , who gave it the name of St. Charles's
         Island. <date>[Thursday 10.]</date>On the 10th, in the morning, the birds of the grey
         tern-kind were innumerable about us, whilst we advanced at the rate of seven miles an hour.
         We lay to during night, being apprehensive of falling in with the land, which we actually
         discovered at five o'clock the next morning. The joy which this fortunate event spread on
         every countenance is scarcely to be described. We had been an hundred and three days out of
         sight of land; and the rigorous weather to the south, the fatigues of continual attendance
         during storms, or amidst dangerous masses of ice, the sudden changes of climate, and the
         long continuance of a noxious diet, all together had emaciated and worn out our crew. The
         expectation of a speedy end to their sufferings, and the hope of finding the land stocked
         with abundance of fowls and planted with fruits, according to the accounts of the Dutch
         navigator, now filled them with uncommon alacrity and cheerfulness.</p>

      <p>We advanced but slowly towards the land by day, to the great disappointment of all on
         board, who became more eager in proportion as new difficulties arose to prolong their
         distresses. The land appeared of a moderate height, and divided into several hills, which
         gently sloped from their summits; its extent did not seem to be considerable, and we were
         at too great a distance to be able to form any conjecture as to its productions.
            <date>[Saturday 12.]</date>The next morning we were becalmed within five leagues of the
         island, which had then a black and somewhat disagreeable appearance. We amused ourselves
         with catching sharks, several of which swam about the ship, and eagerly swallowed the hook,
         which was baited with salt pork or beef. In the afternoon a breeze sprung up, with which we
         stood towards the shore, in great hopes of reaching an anchoring-place before night. The
         land did not look very promising as we advanced, there being little verdure, and scarcely
         any bushes upon it; but to us who had lingered so long under all the distresses of a
         tedious cruize at sea, the most barren rock would have been a welcome sight. In our way we
         perceived a great number of black pillars standing upright, near two hummocks, and in
         different groups. They seemed to be the same which Roggewein's people took for idols ; but
         we guessed already, at that time, that they were such monuments, in memory of the dead, as
         the Taheitians and other people in the South Seas erect near burying-places, and call
         E-Tee.</p>

      <p>The wind, which was contrary and very faint, the approach of night, and the want of an
         anchoring-place on the east side of the island, disappointed us once more, and forced us to
         pass another night under sail, during which we saw several fires in the neighbourhood of
         the pillars above-mentioned. The Dutch, who likewise observed them, called them sacrifices
         to the idols; but it seems to be more probable that they were only lighted to dress the
         food of the natives.</p>

      <p>We passed the night in making several trips, in order to keep to windward of the island and
         as near it as possible, resolving to pursue our search of anchorage the next day. In the
         mean time we reflected on the excellent means of ascertaining the longitude, with which our
         ship had been furnished, and which had carried us exactly to this island, though several
         former navigators, such as Byron, Carteret, and Bougainville had missed it, after taking
         their departure from islands at so short a distance from it as those of Juan Fernandez.
         Captain Carteret it seems was only misled by an erroneous latitude in the geographical
         tables which he consulted; but this could not be the case with the rest. We had the
         greatest reason to admire the ingenious construction of the two watches which we had on
         board, one executed by Mr. Kendal, exactly after the model of that made by Mr. Harrison,
         and the other by Mr. Arnold on his own plan, both which went with great regularity. The
         last was unfortunately stopped immediately after our departure from New Zeeland in June
         1773, but the other went till our return to England, and gave general satisfaction. It
         appears, however, that in a long run the observations of distances of the moon from the sun
         or stars, are more to be depended upon, if they be made with good instruments, than the
         watches or time-keepers, which frequently change their rates of going. The method of
         deducing the longitude from the distances of the sun and moon, or moon and stars, one of
         the most valuable acquisitions to the art of navigation, must immortalize its first
         inventors. Tobias Mayer a German, and professor at Gottingen was the first who undertook
         the laborious task of calculating tables for this purpose, for which his heirs received a
         parliamentary reward. Since his death the method was so much facilitated by additional
         calculations, that the longitude will perhaps never be determined with greater precision at
         sea by any other means.</p>

      <p>The latitude of Easter Island corresponds within a minute or two with that which is marked
         in admiral Roggewein's own MS. journal , and his longitude is only one degree erroneous,
         our observations having ascertained it in 109° 46' west from Greenwich. The Spanish
         accounts of the latitude are likewise exact, but they err in longitude about thirty
         leagues.</p>

      <head>CHAP. IV.</head>

      <p><date>[1774. March.][Sunday 13.]</date>ON the 13th, early in the morning, we ran close to
         the south point of the island, where the shore rose perpendicularly, and consisted of
         broken rocks, whose cavernous appearance, and black or ferruginous colour, seemed to have
         been produced by subterraneous fire. Two detached rocks lay about a quarter of a miles off
         this point; one of them was singular on account of its shape, resembling a huge column or
         obelisk, and both were the habitations of numerous sea-fowls, which stunned our ears with
         their discordant screams. Soon after we opened another point about ten miles distant from
         this, and as we advanced we perceived the ground gently sloping to the sea. On the slope we
         discovered several plantations by the help of our glasses; but the surface of the isle in
         general appeared to be extremely dreary and parched, and these plantations were so thinly
         scattered upon it, that they did not flatter our hopes of meeting with considerable
         refreshments. However, our eyes, long unused to the enchanting prospect of verdure, were
         constantly directed towards the shore, where we distinguished a number of people nearly
         naked, hastily running down from the hills towards the sea-side. We could not perceive that
         they had any arms, which we immediately interpreted into a sign of a peaceable disposition.
         In a few minutes we saw them launch a canoe, in which two men came off towards us. They
         were along side in a short time, having paddled very briskly, and immediately called out
         for a rope, naming it by the same word as the Taheitians. We had no sooner thrown them the
         rope, than they tied a great cluster of ripe bananas to it, making signs for us to haul it
         up. The sudden emotions of joy in every countenance, at the sight of this fruit, are
         scarcely to be described; they can only be felt in their full extent by people in the same
         wretched situation with ourselves at that time. At least fifty persons endeavoured to begin
         a conversation with the people in the canoe, who being addressed by so many at once, could
         not answer one of them. Captain Cook sent for some ribbands, to which he tied some medals
         and beads, and lowered them down in return for their present. They seemed to admire them
         much, but hastened ashore with them immediately. In dropping astern, they fastened a small
         piece of cloth to a fishing-line which we towed after us; it was immediately hauled up, and
         appeared to be made of the same bark as the Taheitian cloth, and coloured yellow. From a
         few words which they pronounced, we concluded their language to be a dialect of the
         Taheitian, which we had now found in both extremities of the South Sea. Their whole
         appearance confirmed us in this opinion, and proved them issued from the same stock. They
         were of a middle stature, but rather thin; their features resembled those of the
         Taheitians, but were less agreeable: one of them had a beard, which was cut to the length
         of about half an inch; the other was a youth of about seventeen. They had punctures of the
         same nature with those used by the natives of the Society and Friendly Islands and of New
         Zeeland; but their whole body, which was perfectly naked, was marked with them. The
         greatest singularity which we observed about them was the size of their ears, of which the
         lap or extremity was stretched out so as almost to rest on the shoulder, and pierced by a
         very large hole, through which four or five fingers might be thrust with ease. This
         circumstance entirely agreed with the description which the serjeant-major of Roggewein's
         ship gives of these people . Their canoe was another curiosity, being patched up of many
         pieces, each of which was not more than four or five inches wide, and two or three feet
         long. Its length might be about ten or twelve feet, its head and stern were raised
         considerably, but its middle was very low. It had an outrigger or balancer made of three
         slender poles, and each of the men had a paddle, of which the blade was likewise composed
         of several pieces. This description also exactly corresponds with the Dutch account of
         Roggewein's voyage, printed at Dort in 1728 ; and sufficiently proved that the island is
         very destitute of wood, though the contrary is ascertained in the serjeant-major's relation
         of that voyage . </p>

      <p>Though we struck soundings opposite the place from whence this canoe put off, yet in hopes
         of finding a better place of anchorage, we ran along the coast of the island, till we came
         in sight of its northern extremity, which we had already seen the day before from the other
         side. But being disappointed in our expectation, we put about with a view to return to the
         place which we had left. A great number of black pillars stood along the shore, many of
         which were elevated on platforms consisting of several ranges of stone. We could now
         distinguish something resembling a human head and shoulders towards their upper end; but
         the lower part appeared to be a rude stone, without being carved into a resemblance of the
         human shape. Sometimes we perceived two, sometimes four, and even five together in a row;
         but some were likewise placed by themselves. We saw but few plantations towards the north
         end, the land being much more bluff or steep there, than about the middle of the island,
         and we could easily perceive that there was not a tree upon the whole island, which
         exceeded the height of ten feet.</p>

      <p>In the afternoon we hoisted out a boat, and the master went towards the shore to take
         soundings in the road, from whence the canoe had come off to us. As soon as the natives
         perceived our boat on the water, they assembled along shore, near the place to which our
         people seemed to direct their course. Among a croud of naked men, we saw some who seemed to
         be dressed in a bright cloth of a yellow, or rather orange colour, from whence we suspected
         that they were their principal people. We now likewise began to discern their houses, which
         seemed to be extremely low and long, highest in the middle, and sloping down towards both
         extremities. They much resembled a canoe turned with the keel or bottom upwards. In the
         middle there seemed to be a small entrance or door, which was so low, that a man of a
         common size must stoop to get in. Towards evening we let go our anchor in about forty
         fathom, gravelly bottom off the S. W. part of the island. The master returned presently
         after, and brought one of the natives in the boat with him. This bold fellow had jumped
         into the boat without any ceremony or invitation, while it was close to the shore, and
         expressly desired to be brought on board. He was of the middle size, about five feet eight
         inches high, and remarkably hairy on the breast and all over the body. His colour was a
         chestnut brown, his beard strong, but clipped short, and of a black colour, as was also the
         hair of his head, which was likewise cut short. His ears were very long, almost hanging on
         his shoulders, and his legs punctured in compartments after a taste which we had observed
         no where else. He had only a belt round his middle, from whence a kind of net-work
         descended before, too thin to conceal any thing from the sight. A string was tied about his
         neck, and a flat bone, something shaped like a tongue, and about five inches long, was
         fastened to it, and hung down on the breast. This, he told us, was a porpoise's bone (eevee
         toharra), expressing it exactly by the same words which a Taheitian would have made use of.
         To explain himself better, he also called it eevee-eeka, which we well understood to
         signify the bone of a fish . He was no sooner seated in the boat, than he complained of
         being cold by shivering, and making various gestures of a very intelligible nature. Mr.
         Gilbert, the master, therefore gave him a jacket, and put a hat on his head, and in that
         dress he appeared upon deck. The captain and passengers presented him with nails, medals,
         and strings of beads, the last of which, he desired to have tied round his head. At the
         beginning he shewed some marks of fear or diffidence, asking whether we should kill him as
         an enemy (matte-toa?) but upon being assured of good treatment and friendship on our part,
         he seemed perfectly secure and unconcerned, and talked of nothing but dancing (heeva). It
         was with some difficulty that we understood him at first; but having enquired for the names
         by which he distinguished the parts of the body, we soon found them to be nearly the same
         with those which are used in the Society Isles. If we mentioned a word which he did not
         comprehend, he repeated it several times with a look which strongly expressed his ignorance
         of it. As night approached, he said he wanted to go to sleep, and complained of cold. My
         father gave him a large Taheitee cloth of the thickest sort, in which he wrapped himself,
         saying he found it comfortably warm. He was afterwards conducted into the master's cabin,
         where he law down on a table, and slept very quietly the whole night. Mahineur new visitor
         several times, but was interrupted by the questions which many other persons in the ship
         put to him.</p>

      <p><date>[Monday 14.]</date>We dragged our anchor during night, and drove off the bank, so
         that we were obliged to set sail again, in order to recover our situation. Immediately
         after breakfast, captain Cook went ashore with the native, whose name was Maroowahai,
         together with Mahine, my father, Dr. Sparrman, and myself, though my feet and legs were
         still swelled excessively, and I was hardly able to walk. We found a snug cove for boats,
         among a number of rocks which sheltered the landing-place from the mountainous swell that
         tumbled in upon the shore. About a hundred, or a hundred and fifty natives were assembled
         on the spot where we landed, almost all of them naked, some having only a belt round the
         middle, from whence a small bit of cloth, six or eight inches long, or a little net, hung
         down before. A very few of them had a cloak which reached to the knees, made of cloth,
         resembling that of Taheitee in the texture, and stitched or quilted with thread to make it
         the more lasting. Most of these cloaks were painted yellow with the turmeric-root. The
         people did not make the least unfriendly motion at our landing, but expressed a prodigious
         dread of our fire-arms, of which they seemed to know the deadly effects. We saw but few
         arms among them; some however had lances or spears, made of thin ill-shapen sticks, and
         pointed with a sharp triangular piece of a black glassy lava (pumex vitreus, Linn.)
         commonly called Iceland agate. One of them had a fighting club, made of a thick piece of
         wood about three feet long, carved at one extremity; and a few others had short wooden
         clubs, exactly resembling some of the New Zeeland patoo-patoos, which are made of bone. We
         observed some who had European hats and caps, chequered cotton handkerchiefs, and ragged
         jackets of blue woollen-cloth, which were so many indubitable testimonies of the visit
         which the Spaniards had made to this island in 1770. The general appearance of the natives
         seemed to argue a great sterility of the country. They were inferior in stature to the
         natives of the Society and Friendly Isles, and to those of New Zeeland, there being not a
         single person amongst them, who might be reckoned tall. Their body was likewise lean, and
         their face thinner than that of any people we had hitherto seen in the South Sea. Their
         want of cloathing, and a great eagerness to obtain out goods without offering any thing in
         return, seemed altogether to be sufficient marks of poverty. They were all prodigiously
         punctured on every part of the body, the face in particular; and their women, who were very
         small and slender limbed, had likewise punctures on the face, which resembled the patches
         sometimes worn by our ladies. The number of women in the croud did not exceed ten or
         twelve; they were seldom satisfied with their natural clear brown colour, but painted the
         whole face with a reddish brown ruddle, over which they laid on the bright orange of the
         turmeric-root; or ornamented themselves with elegant streaks of white shell-lime. The art
         of painting is therefore not confined to those ladies who have the happiness to imitate
         French fashions. The women were all dressed in pieces of cloth, which appeared scanty when
         compared to the Taheitian dresses. Both sexes had thin, but not savage features, though the
         little shelter which their barren country offers against the sun-beams, had contracted
         their brows sometimes, and drawn the muscles of the face up towards the eye. Their noses
         were not very broad, but rather flat between the eyes; their lips strong, though not so
         thick as those of negroes; and their hair black and curling, but always cut short, so as
         not to exceed three inches. Their eyes were dark brown, and rather small, the white being
         less clear than in other nations of the South Seas. Their ears were remarkable for the
         great length of the lap, which frequently hung on the shoulder, and was pierced with so
         large a hole, that the extremity could be tucked up through it. In order to bring it to
         this size, they wore a leaf of a sugar cane, which is very elastic, rolled up in it like a
         scroll; by which means it was always on the stretch. The violent action of the sun upon
         their heads has forced them to contrive various coverings for that part. Many of the men
         wore a ring about two inches thick, strongly and curiously plaited of grass, and fitting
         close round the head. This was covered with great quantities of the long black feathers
         which decorate the neck of the man of war bird. Others had huge bushy caps of brown gulls
         feathers, which were almost as large as the full bottomed wigs of European lawyers; and
         still others wore a simple hoop of wood, round which a number of the long white feathers of
         a gannet hung nodding, and waved in the wind. The women wore a great wide cap, made of very
         neat mat-work; it was pointed forwards, formed a ridge along the top, and two large lobes
         behind on each side, which we found extremely cooling for the head. Mr. Hodges drew the
         figure of a woman with this cap on, and of a man with one of the other head dresses; both
         are extremely characteristic of the nation, and have been engraved for captain Cook's
         account of this voyage. The only ornaments which we saw among them, were the flat pieces of
         bone in the shape of a tongue, or like a laurel leaf, which both sexes wore hanging on
         their breast, together with some necklaces and ear-jewels made of shells.</p>

      <p>After staying among the natives for some time on the beach, we began to walk into the
         country. The whole ground was covered with rocks and stones of all sizes, which seemed to
         have been exposed to a great fire, where they had acquired a black colour and porous
         appearance. Two of three shrivelled species of grasses grew up among these stones, and in a
         slight degree softened the desolate appearance of the country. About fifteen yards from the
         landing-place we saw a perpendicular wall of square hewn stones, about a foot and a half or
         two feet long, and one foot broad. Its greatest height was about seven or eight feet, but
         it gradually sloped on both sides, and its length might be about twenty yards. A remarkable
         circumstance was the junction of these stones, which were laid after the most excellent
         rules of art, fitting in such a manner as to make a durable piece of architecture. The
         stone itself of which they are cut is not of great hardness being a blackish brown
         cavernous and brittle stony lava. The ground rose from the water's side upwards; so that
         another wall, parallel to the first, about twelve yards from it and facing the country, was
         not above two or three feet high. The whole area between the two walls was filled up with
         soil and covered with grass. About fifty yards farther to the south there was another
         elevated area, of which the surface was paved with square stones exactly similar to those
         which formed the walls. In the midst of this area, there was a pillar consisting of a
         single stone, which represented a human figure to the waist, about twenty feet high, and
         upwards of five feet wide. The workmanship of this figure was rude, and spoke the arts in
         their infancy. The eyes, nose, and mouth were scarcely marked on a lumpish ill-shaped head;
         and the ears, which were excessively long, quite in the fashion of the country, were better
         executed than any other part, though a European artist would have been ashamed of them. The
         neck was clumsy and short, and the shoulders and arms very slightly represented. On the top
         of the head a huge round cylinder of stone was placed upright, being above five feet in
         diameter and in height. This cap, which resembled the head-dress of some Egyptian divinity,
         consisted of a different stone from the rest of the pillar, being of a more reddish colour;
         and had a hole on each side, as if it had been made round by turning. The cap together with
         the head, made one half of the whole pillar which appeared above ground. We did not observe
         that the natives paid any worship to these pillars, yet they seemed to hold them in some
         kind of veneration, as they sometimes expressed a dislike when we walked over the paved
         area or pedestals, or examined the stone of which it consisted.</p>

      <p>A few of the natives accompanied us farther on into the country, where we had seen some
         bushes at a distance, which we hoped would afford us something new. Our road was
         intolerably rugged, over heaps of volcanic stones, which rolled away under our feet, and
         against which we continually hurt ourselves. The natives, who were accustomed to this
         desolate ground, skipped nimbly from stone to stone without the least difficulty. In our
         way we saw several black rats running about, which it seems are common to every island in
         the South Sea. Being arrived at the shrubbery which we had in view, we found it was nothing
         but a small plantation of the paper mulberry, of which here, as well as at Taheitee, they
         make their cloth. Its stems were from two to four feet high, and planted in rows, among
         very large rocks, where the rains had washed a little soil together. In the neighbourhood
         of these we saw some bushes of the hibiscus populneus, Linn. which is common also in the
         Society Isles, where it is one of the numerous plants made use of to dye yellow; and
         likewise a mimosa, which is the only shrub that affords the natives sticks for their clubs
         and pattoo-pattoos, and wood sufficient to patch up a canoe.</p>

      <p>We found the face of the country more barren and ruinous the farther we advanced. The small
         number of inhabitants, who met us at the landing-place, seemed to have been the bulk of the
         nation, since we met no other people on our walk; and yet for these few we did not see
         above ten or twelve huts, though the view commanded a great part of the island. One of the
         sightliest of these was situated on a little hillock, about half a mile from the sea, which
         we ascended. Its construction was such as evinced the poverty and wretched condition of its
         owners. The foundation consisted of stones about a foot long, laid level with the surface
         in two curve lines, converging at the extremities. These lines were about six feet asunder
         in the middle, but not above one foot at the ends. In every stone of this foundation we
         observed one or two holes, in each of which a stake was inserted. The middlemost stakes
         were six feet high, but the others gradually diminished to two feet. On the top the stakes
         all converged, and were tied by strings to transverse sticks, by which they were kept
         together. A kind of thatch, made of small sticks, and covered with a neat mat-work of
         sugar-cane leaves, leaned on each row of stakes, forming a very sharp ridge or angle at the
         top, and resting firmly on the ground at the bottom. A hole was left on one side, about
         eighteen inches or two feet high, over which the people had built a round projecting funnel
         to keep off the wet. We crept on all fours into this opening, and found the inside of the
         hut perfectly naked and empty, there being not so much as a wisp of straw to lie down upon.
         We could not stand upright in any part except just in the middle, and the whole place
         appeared dark and dismal. The natives told us they passed the night in these huts, and we
         easily conceived their situation to be uncomfortable, especially as we saw so very few of
         them, that they must be crammed full, unless the generality of the people lie in the open
         air, and leave these wretched dwellings to their chiefs, or make use of them only in bad
         weather.</p>

      <p>Besides these huts, we observed some heaps of stones piled up into little hillocks, which
         had one steep perpendicular side, where a hole went under ground. The space within could be
         but very small, and yet it is probable that these cavities likewise served to give shelter
         to the people during night. They may, however, communicate with natural caverns, which are
         very common in the lava currents of volcanic countries. Such caverns are very frequent in
         Iceland famous for having been the dwelling-places of the ancient inhabitants. Mr. Ferber,
         the first mineralogical historian of Vesuvius, has noticed such a subterraneous hole in one
         of the modern lavas of that mountain. We should have been glad to have ascertained this
         circumstance, but the natives always denied us admittance into these places.</p>

      <p>A plantation of sugar-canes and one of bananas adjoined to the house we had visited, and
         both were in excellent order, considering the stony quality of the ground. The bananas were
         all growing in holes one foot deep, which we supposed to be contrived for collecting the
         rain, and preserving it for a longer time about the plant. The sugar-canes were about nine
         or ten feet high, even in this parched country, and contained a very sweet juice, which the
         inhabitants presented to us very frequently, and particularly whenever we asked for
         something to drink. We concluded from thence that they had no water on the island; but
         coming back to the landing-place we met captain Cook, whom the natives had conducted to a
         well very close to the sea, which was cut deep into the rock, but full of impurities. When
         our people had cleared it, they found the water in it rather brackish, but the natives
         drank of it with much seeming satisfaction.</p>

      <p>Captain Cook had not been very fortunate in trading with the people. They seemed indeed to
         be so destitute as to have no provisions to spare. A few matted baskets full of sweet
         potatoes, some sugar-canes, bunches of bananas, and two or three small fowls ready dressed,
         were the whole purchase which he had made for a few iron tools, and some Taheitee cloth. He
         had presented the people with beads, but they always threw them away with contempt, as far
         as ever they could. Whatever else they saw about us, they were desirous of possessing,
         though they had nothing to give in return. Their number was now decreased nearly to one
         half, many of them having probably gone home to their dinners; however, the number of women
         was always remarkably small in proportion to the men, there being not above twelve or
         fifteen at our first landing, and about six or seven when we embarked again. They were
         neither reserved nor chaste, and for the trifling consideration of a small piece of cloth,
         some of our sailors obtained the gratification of their desires. Their features were mild
         enough, and the large pointed cap gave them the air of professed wantons.</p>

      <p>We returned on board the ship before noon, and found it at anchor, though we had left it
         under sail. The fresh fruits and roots which we brought on board, were immediately
         distributed as far as they would go, and proved a most reasonable refreshment to our sick.
         We tasted the fowls, which seemed to have been dressed under-ground, by means of hot stones
         being wrapped up in green leaves, in the manner practised amongst all the nations of the
         South Sea, whom we had hitherto visited. The potatoes were of a gold-yellow colour, and as
         sweet as carrots, therefore not equally palatable to us all; however, they were extremely
         nourishing, and very antiscorbutic. The juices of this, and all the other vegetables on
         this island, seemed to have been concentrated by the dryness of the soil. Their bananas
         were reckoned very delicious in their kind, by those who were fond of this fruit, and their
         sugar-canes were sweeter than any we had tasted at Taheitee.</p>

      <p>In the afternoon we returned on shore again, and an officer went with another boat to fill
         water at the well. We found but few natives near the landing-place, and among them was one,
         who appeared to have some little authority, and readily accompanied the captain wherever he
         went. He was not so timorous as the rest of his countrymen, but walked boldly along with
         us, whilst the others were alarmed at the least motion which appeared unusual to them. This
         disposition, however, did not prevent them from picking our pockets, or stealing any thing
         which suited them. We had not been half an hour on shore, when one of them came behind
         Mahine, and very nimbly snatching a black cap from his head, ran off with the greatest
         velocity over the heaps of rugged stones, where it was impossible to follow him. Mahine was
         so surprised, that it was some time before he could find words to complain to the captain;
         and when he did it, the thief was already at a great distance. About the same time, as Mr.
         Hodges was fitting on a little eminence, and sketching a view of the country, one of the
         natives ran off with his hat in the same manner. Mr. Wales was standing by him with a
         musket in his hand, but very justly reflected, that so slight a crime did not deserve the
         punishment of a leaden bullet.</p>

      <p>In our walk along the sea-shore, we discovered a few stalks of the same species of celery
         which is plentiful on the beaches of New Zeeland, and we also found two other little plants
         common to that country. Whether these plants originally existed on the island, or sprung up
         from seeds, which the current of the sea, or birds by their plumage might transport from
         the opposite side of the ocean, I cannot venture to determine. We likewise met with a
         plantation of yams (dioscorea alata, Linn.) which in so poor a flora as that of Easter
         Island was a great addition. The great correspondence in the features, customs, and
         languages of these people, to those of other natives of the South Sea islands, gave us some
         room to hope for such domestic animals among them, as we had observed at Taheitee or New
         Zeeland. But notwithstanding the most diligent search, we never met with any other than
         common fowls, which were of a very small breed, and had a dull plumage. It is true we
         observed also two or three noddies, which were so tame as to settle on the shoulders of the
         natives, but from these individuals we could not conclude, that they kept a regular breed
         of them.</p>

      <p>About sun-set we left the watering-place, and walked to the cove where our boat lay at a
         grapnel. In our way we passed over the area on which the single pillar before-mentioned was
         placed. A few natives who still accompanied us, made signs that we should descend, and walk
         in the grass at the foot of the pedestal; but seeing that we did not care to understand
         their gestures, they made no other attempt to oppose our progress. We put some questions to
         the most intelligent persons among them, concerning the nature of these stones, and from
         what we could understand, we concluded that they were monuments erected to the memory of
         some of their areekees, or kings. This led us to believe that the pedestal was perhaps to
         be considered as a burying-place, and on looking carefully round it, we found a number of
         human bones, which confirmed our conjecture. The length of these bones was exactly such as
         might be expected in persons of a middle stature, and a thigh-bone which we measured,
         exactly corresponded with that of a person about five feet nine inches high. To the
         westward of the cove, there was a range of three pillars, standing on a very large elevated
         area or pedestal. This range the natives distinguished by the name of hanga-roa, and the
         single pillar they called obeena. About ten or twelve people were seated at a little
         distance from the last, round a small fire, over which they had roasted a few potatoes.
         These served for their supper, and they offered us some of them as we passed by. We were
         much surprised with this instance of hospitality in so poor a country, especially when we
         compared it to the customs of civilized nations, who have almost entirely laid aside all
         tender feelings for the wants of their fellow-creatures. At the same time we were very glad
         to be convinced, that the conjectures of the Dutch concerning the fires which they saw on
         this island, were ill-founded, as we did not see the least reason to suppose, that they
         were lighted for religious purposes. We now embarked with a small quantity of potatoes, and
         with about six or seven common plants, which we had gathered, and returned on board. Those
         only who were ill of the scurvy, reaped some benefit from their visit to the shore. I who
         went out in the morning with my legs excessively swelled, and so tender that I could hardly
         stand upon them, returned on board much better; the swelling was something reduced, and my
         pains at least were gone. I could not attribute this sudden change to any thing else, than
         the exercise I had taken on shore, and perhaps to those salutary antiscorbutic effluvia of
         the land, which it is said, are alone sufficient to recover those, who have contracted the
         scurvy on a long cruize at sea.</p>

      <p><date>[Tuesday 15.]</date>Early the next morning, captain Cook appointed a party of marines
         and sailors, under the command of lieutenants Pickersgill and Edgecumbe, to reconnoitre the
         interior parts of the country, in order to be convinced if possible, whether any other part
         was better cultivated, or more closely inhabited than that which we had hitherto seen. Mr.
         Wales, Mr. Hodges, Dr. Sparrman, and my father associated with them, so that the whole
         party consisted of twenty-seven men.</p>

      <p>After breakfast I accompanied captain Cook and several officers ashore, where we found
         about two hundred inhabitants assembled, amongst whom were fourteen or fifteen women, and
         very few children. It was impossible for us to guess at the cause of this disproportion in
         the number of the different sexes; but as all the women we saw were very liberal of their
         favours, I conjectured at that time, that the married and the modest, who might be supposed
         to form the greater part, did not care to come near us, or were forced by the men to stay
         at their dwellings in the remote parts of the island. Those few who appeared were the most
         lascivious of their sex, that perhaps have ever been noticed in any country, and shame
         seemed to be entirely unknown to them; our sailors likewise disclaimed all acquaintance
         with modesty, for nothing but the shadow of the gigantic monument screened them from the
         sun.</p>

      <p>Mr. Patton, lieutenant Clerke, and myself left the seaside, where the concourse was
         greatest, and took a walk into the country. The heat of the sun was very violent, the beams
         being reverberated from the broken ground, and there was not a single tree to give us
         shelter. My companions had taken their fowling-pieces in hopes of meeting with some birds;
         but they were greatly disappointed, there being probably no other land-birds on the island
         than the common fowl, which were tame and extremely scarce. We followed one of the paths
         which the natives had made, till we came to a cultivated spot, consisting of several fields
         planted with sweet potatoes, yams, and eddoes, together with a species of night-shade,
         which is made use of at Taheitee and the neighbouring islands as a vulnerary remedy,
         (solanum nigrum?) and may, for ought I know, be cultivated here for the same purpose. The
         grass, which commonly springs up among the stones on the uncultivated soil, was here
         carefully plucked up, and spread over the whole plantation as a manure, or perhaps to
         preserve it in some measure from the parching beams of the sun. It should seem from these
         circumstances that the natives are not altogether ignorant of rural œconomy, and till the
         ground at a great expence of time and labour. At a little distance from these fields we met
         with two huts, constructed exactly like that which I have mentioned page 569, but much
         smaller. The entrance was stopped up with a great quantity of small brushwood, and we at
         first imagined that we heard the voices of women within, but after listening for some time
         we heard nothing farther to confirm us in this belief. We rambled from thence to the top of
         a hillock covered with shrubberies, which we found to consist of nothing but a species of
         mimosa, that scarcely attained the height of eight feet, and afforded us very little
         shelter from the sun. Here we rested a while, and then descended by a different route into
         another set of fields, which were treated in the same manner as the rest. None of them had
         any sort of enclosures, though the historians of Roggewein's voyage, who seem to have
         consulted fancy more than truth, make mention of them. The encreasing heat of the day had
         entirely exhausted us, when we had still a considerable way to make down to the sea-side.
         Fortunately we passed by a native who was at work, gathering potatoes in one of the fields.
         We complained of great thirst to him, upon which, though he was an old man, he immediately
         ran to a large plantation of sugar-canes, and brought us a great load of the best and
         juiciest on his back. We made him some presents in return for them, cut them into
         walking-sticks, and, as we went along, gradually peeled and sucked them, finding their
         juice extremely refreshing.</p>

      <p>At our return to the landing-place we found captain Cook still occupied in trading with the
         inhabitants, who brought him some fowls ready dressed, and some matted baskets full of
         sweet potatoes, but sometimes deceived him by filling the basket with stones, and only
         laying a few potatoes at the top. The most valuable article of trade on our part were empty
         coco-nut shells, which we had received at the Society and Friendly Islands; but they were
         not current, unless the hole in them was very small, or unless they had a cover. The
         Taheitian and European cloths were valued in the next degree according to the size of the
         pieces; and iron-ware bore an inferior price. The greatest part of the natives who traded
         with us instantly ran off with the cloth, nut-shell, or the nail which had been given in
         exchange for their potatoes, as if they were apprehensive that we might repent of our
         bargain, even though they dealt honestly with us. Some among them were bold enough to run
         off with what they had received, as the price of their provisions, before they had
         delivered up the goods for which we had bargained. From such circumstances the deplorable
         condition of the natives became more and more conspicuous. The scarcity of cloth among them
         was extremely great, most of the people being forced to go naked; but this did not prevent
         their selling what little cloth they had in exchange for that of Taheitee. The desire of
         possessing this cloth prompted them to expose to sale several articles which perhaps they
         would not have parted with so easily under other circumstances. Among these were their
         different caps or head-dresses, their necklaces, ornaments for the ear, and several human
         figures, made of narrow pieces of wood about eighteen inches or two feet long, and wrought
         in a much neater and more proportionate manner than we could have expected, after seeing
         the rude sculpture of the statues. They were made to represent persons of both sexes; the
         features were not very pleasing, and the whole figure was much too long to be natural;
         however, there was something characteristic in them, which shewed a taste for the arts. The
         wood of which they were made was finely polished, close-grained, and of a dark-brown, like
         that of the casuarina. But as we had not yet seen this tree growing here, we eagerly
         expected the return of our party, hoping they would make some discoveries to explain this
         circumstance. Mahine was most pleased with these carved human figures, the workman of which
         much excelled those of the e Tees in his country, and he purchased several of them,
         assuring us they would be greatly valued at Taheitee. As he took great pains to collect
         these curiosities, he once met with a figure of a woman's hand, carved of a yellowish wood,
         nearly of the natural size. Upon examination, its fingers were all bent upwards, as they
         are in the action of dancing at Taheitee, and its nails were represented very long,
         extending at least three fourths of an inch beyond the fingers' end. The wood of which it
         was made was the rare perfume-wood of Taheitee, with the chips of which they communicate
         fragrance to their oils. We had neither seen this wood growing, nor observed the custom of
         wearing long nails at this island, and therefore were at a loss to conceive how this piece
         of well-executed carving could be met with there; we hoped, however, to unravel this
         circumstance also at the return of our party. Mahine afterwards presented this piece to my
         father, who has in his turn made a present of it to the British Museum. Mahine was likewise
         very eager to collect as many feathered caps as he could meet with, especially those which
         had the feathers of a man of war bird, that bird being very scarce about Taheitee, and much
         valued on account of its glossy black colour.</p>

      <p>Whilst captain Cook continued in the cove, another trade for potatoes was carried on at the
         watering-place. Here the desire of possessing our goods, made some of the natives guilty of
         a crime against their own countryman. A field of sweet potatoes was situated close to the
         well, and a considerable number of people of different ages and sizes, busied themselves in
         digging them up, and bringing them for sale to our people. They had carried on this
         occupation for some hours, when another native arrived, who was in a vehement passion with
         them, and drove them all away, remaining alone to dig the roots up himself. He was the
         owner of the field, whom the rest had robbed of the fruits of his labour, finding an easy
         method to dispose of their stolen goods. It is not to be doubted that these offences
         against the laws of civil society, are sometimes committed even at the Society Isles,
         because the inhabitants have often told us, that they inflicted a capital punishment upon
         such offenders; but we never saw any instances of it there. On this occasion at Easter
         Island, we did not observe that they annexed any penalty to the crime, though we saw it
         committed. Perhaps this is owing to the different degree of civilization of those two
         cogeneric tribes.</p>

      <p>We went on board at noon, where we dined on some fowls and potatoes, which we found
         delicious after the fatigues of the morning. We observed a few natives on board, who had
         ventured to swim off, though the ship lay about three quarters of a mile from the shore.
         They expressed the most unbounded admiration at every thing they saw, and every one of them
         measured the whole length of the vessel from head to stern, with his extended arms; such a
         great quantity of timber of so stupendous a size, being altogether incomprehensible to
         people whose canoes were patched of many small bits of wood. Among them was one woman, who
         had arrived on board in the same manner, and carried on a particular traffic of her own.
         She visited several of the inferior officers, and then addressed herself to the sailors,
         emulating the famous exploits of Messalina . A few English rags, and some pieces of
         Taheitee cloth, were the spoils which she carried away with her, being fetched off by a man
         in the patched canoe, which was perhaps the only one in the island. Another of her
         country-women had visited our ship the day before, and been equally unbounded in her
         revels. It remained a doubt with us, whether we should most admire their success among a
         sickly crew, exhausted by the long continuance of a noxious diet, or their own spirit and
         insatiate temper.</p>

      <p>In the afternoon we returned to the shore again, and I walked on the hills to the
         southward, which rose with a very easy slope. Here I met with a large plantation of
         bananas, beyond which I found some remains of a stone wall, which was perhaps once the base
         of a statue. From thence I crossed some fields, where I saw a family of the natives at
         work, taking potatoes out of the ground. I walked up to their hut, which was one of the
         smallest I had yet seen, and as they came about me, I sat down among them. Their whole
         number amounted to six or seven persons, one of whom was a woman, and two were young boys.
         They presented me with some sugar-canes, and in return, I made them a present of a small
         piece of Taheitee cloth, which they immediately wrapped about the head. They did not
         express that great curiosity which we had observed among the people of the Society Isles,
         but soon returned to their former occupation, in which all were employed without exception.
         Some of them had head-dresses made of feathers, which they readily offered to exchange for
         pieces of cloth no bigger than a handkerchief. About the hut I perceived a few fowls, the
         only ones which I had seen alive on the island. Their behaviour towards me was wholly
         inoffensive, agreeably to the general character of the nations in the South Sea. From the
         expressions of the historians of Roggewein's voyage, it should seem, that the Dutch very
         wantonly fired upon the natives, who gave no provocation, and killed a considerable number
         of them, intimidating the rest to a great degree. It is probable, that the terror with
         which they looked upon the destructive arms of Europeans at that time, and during the late
         visit of the Spaniards, was revived among them at our appearance, and had an influence on
         their general timid behaviour towards us; but it is not to be doubted, at the same time,
         that there is a mildness, fellow-feeling, and good-nature in their disposition, which
         naturally prompts them to treat their visitors kindly, and even hospitably, as far as their
         wretched country will permit.</p>

      <p>I returned the same way by which I came, and soon after went on board the ship with captain
         Cook. About nine o'clock a musket was fired on shore, as a signal for a boat, and the
         pinnace being sent off, returned soon after with our party, who had been to examine the
         island. My father being more fatigued than any body else, on account of his long rheumatic
         complaint, was obliged to go to bed immediately; but the other gentlemen supped with us, on
         a few fowls which we had purchased on shore, and gave us some account of their travels. As
         it will be most agreeable to see it in connection, I shall here insert that which I have
         extracted from my father's journal.</p>

      <p>" Immediately after landing, we walked directly inland or across the country, under the
         highest hill which lies towards the south, till we came to the other side of the island.
         About an hundred natives, and among them four or five women, accompanied us on our march,
         and sold us a quantity of potatoes and a few fowls, which we added to our stock of
         provisions. We found the whole country strewed with stones of various sizes, of a cavernous
         or spongy texture, and of a black, brown, or reddish colour, which had indubitable marks of
         having been in a volcanic fire. The paths through this rugged ground are in some measure
         cleared of the stones, but so very narrow, that we were obliged to turn our toes inwards,
         at which the natives are perfectly expert, and to set one foot exactly before the other.
         This mode of walking was excessively fatiguing to us who were not used to it, so that we
         continually hurt our feet or stumbled. On both sides the ground was covered with a thing
         perennial Jamaica-grass (paspalum), which grew in bunches or tufts, and was so slippery
         that we could not walk on it. We reached the east side of the island, near a range of seven
         pillars or statues, of which only four remained standing, and one of them had lost its cap.
         They stood on a common pedestal, like those which we had seen on the other side, and its
         stones were square and fitted exactly in the same manner. Though the stone of which the
         statue itself is formed seems to be soft enough, being nothing but the red tufa which
         covers the whole island, yet it was incomprehensible to me how such great masses could be
         formed by a set of people among whom we saw no tools; or raised and erected by them without
         machinery. The general appellation of this range was Hanga Tebòw; hanga being the word
         which they prefix to every range. The names of the statues were Ko -Tomoaï, Ko-Tomoèeree,
         Ko-Hòo-oo, Morahèena, Oomarèeva, Weenâboo, Weenapè.</p>

      <p>" From hence we continued our march to the northward along the sea, having a precipice on
         our right. The ground was the same ferrugineous tufa for a considerable way, covered with
         small fragments; but after some time we came to a spot which was a single coherent rock or
         lump of black melted lava, which appeared to contain some iron. There was not soil, grass,
         or plant whatsoever upon it. Beyond it we passed through a number of plantations of
         bananas, potatoes, and yams, and one of eddoes. The grass between the stones was plucked up
         and spread on the land, to screen it from the sun, to keep the moisture of the rain in it,
         and at last to manure it.</p>

      <p>" The natives continued to offer some potatoes for sale ready dressed, and, at a hut where
         we halted, they sold us some fish. Some of them carried arms, which were no other than the
         thin sticks we had seen before, and which were headed with a black vitreous lava, carefully
         wrapped in a small piece of cloth. Only one of them had a battle-axe, resembling that of
         the New Zeelanders, though much shorter. It had a head carved on each side, and a small
         round portion of the black glass above-mentioned instead of eyes. They had likewise some
         small crooked human figures made of wood, of which we could not learn the use or
         signification; we did not, however, think that our ignorance on this subject intitled us to
         call them idols, which is too commonly the judgment passed upon the works of art of unknown
         nations.</p>

      <p>" After leaving this hut we still advanced to the northward, without seeing any new
         objects. A man and a woman met us from some neighbouring houses, each with a large matted
         bag, of very neat workmanship, filled with hot potatoes, and placed themselves by the side
         of the path where we were to pass. As we came on, the man presented each of us with some of
         the roots, and having distributed a portion to the whole party, he ran with amazing
         swiftness to the head of our file to share out the rest, till he had given away the whole.
         He received a large piece of cloth from me, which was the only requital for an instance of
         hospitality, of which I never saw the like even at Taheitee. Soon after the natives told us
         their aree, or hareekee, or king was coming towards us. Several men came on before him, and
         distributed sugar-canes to us all in sign of friendship, at the same time pronouncing the
         word heeo , which signifies friend. We now saw the king standing on a hill, and walked up
         to him, Mr. Pickersgill and myself making him some presents. We asked for his name, which
         he told us was Ko Toheetai, adding that he was aree or king. We were desirous of knowing
         whether he was only the chief of a district, or of the whole island; upon which he spread
         out his arms, as it were to include the whole island, and said Waihu. To shew that we
         understood him, we laid our hands on his breast, and, calling him by name, added his title,
         king of Waihu, at which he expressed very great satisfaction, and conversed a great deal
         with his people on that subject. He was a middle-aged man, rather tall; his face and whole
         body strongly punctured. He wore a piece of cloth made of the mulberry bark, quilted with
         threads of grass, and stained yellow with turmerick; and on his head he had a cap of long
         shining black feathers, which might be called a diadem. We did not perceive any great
         degree of homage or attention paid to him by the people; and indeed in so poor a country
         there seems to be nothing which he could have reserved for himself, without a manifest
         incroachment on the natural rights of mankind, which might have produced dangerous effects.
         When we wanted to continue our march he seemed to dislike it, and desired us to return,
         offering to accompany us; but seeing our officer determined to proceed at all events he
         desisted, and went with us.</p>

      <p>" We marched to an elevated spot, and stopped a little while to take some refreshments, and
         to give Mr. Hodges time to draw some of the monuments, near one of which we found an entire
         skeleton of a man. A good view of some of these monuments is inserted in captain Cook's
         account of this voyage. Our people sat down on the ground, and laid their bundles of
         provision before them, whilst the officers, and other gentlemen with myself, conversed with
         the natives. One of our sailors, who carried my plant-bag, in which were a few nails,
         &amp;c. being less careful of his bundle than the rest, a native snatched it up and ran off
         with it. None of us saw it, except lieutenant Edgecumb, who immediately fired his musket,
         loaded with small shot, at the thief, and thus gave the alarm to us all. The native being
         wounded threw down the bag, which our people recovered, but he fell soon after; his
         countrymen took him up, and fled to a little distance, till we beckoned to them to return,
         which almost all of them did. Though this was the only instance of firing at a native
         during our stay at Easter Island, yet it is to be lamented that Europeans too often assume
         the power of inflicting punishments on people who are utterly unacquainted with their
         laws.</p>

      <p>" From this spot we continued our march a good way inland, and were conducted to a deep
         well, which appeared to have been formed by art, and contained good fresh water, though
         somewhat troubled. We all drank heartily of it, and then went on, passing by several large
         statues, which had been overturned, till we came in sight of the two hummocks, near which
         we had perceived the greatest number of pillars or statues, from the ship, on the 12th. We
         mounted on an eminence in the neighbourhood, from whence we beheld the sea on both sides of
         the island, across a plain which we had likewise discovered from the ship at that time. We
         viewed the whole eastern coast, and its numerous pillars, and were convinced that there was
         no bay or harbour on that side of the island. With this information we returned back to a
         large statue, which the natives called Mangototo, and in the shade of which we dined. In
         its neighbourhood we met with another huge statue, which lay overturned; it was
         twenty-seven feet long, and nine feet in diameter, exceeding in magnitude every other
         pillar which we had seen on the island.</p>

      <p>" In returning, we stopped once more at the well, and quenched our thirst, which the raging
         heat of the sun, reverberated from barren rocks, had excited. From thence we directed our
         march something nearer the ridge of hills which run along the middle of the island, but
         found the path more rugged and fatiguing than ever, the country being strewed with volcanic
         cinders, and desolate all round us, though we found many remaining proofs of its having
         been formerly cultivated. I now felt how much I had been weakened by the long continuance
         of the rheumatism, which had crippled all my limbs, and was hardly able to keep up with the
         rest, though I had formerly, upon similar occasions, been indefatigable. The natives seeing
         us strike into a difficult path had all left us, except one man and a little boy. Finding
         that our officers with their party, went too much out of their way, by mistaking the
         direction of our ship, I left them; and with Dr. Sparrman, a sailor, and the two natives,
         pursued the nearest path, which the latter had plainly pointed out. The man seeing me very
         faint, offered me his hand, and walking on the loose stones by the side of the path, with
         amazing dexterity supported me for a considerable way; the little boy going before, and
         picking up the stones which obstructed the path. By resting several times, we were at last
         enabled to reach the summit of the hill, from whence we saw the sea to the west, and the
         ship at anchor. The hill was covered with a shrubbery of the mimosa, which grew here to the
         height of eight or nine feet, and some of whose stems near the root, were about the
         thickness of a man's thigh. We found another well hereabouts, of which the water was
         infected with a putrid taste, and the smell of hepar sulphuris, but of which we drank,
         notwithstanding its nauseousness. The sun set very soon after we had left this well; so
         that we continued our walk downwards, for more than two hours entirely in the dark, during
         which my Indian's assistance was particularly valuable to me. I waited for Mr. Pickersgill
         and the rest of the party, having gained near three miles upon them, and arrived safely at
         the sea-side with them, after walking at the lowest computation, at least five and twenty
         miles on the most detestable roads, where not a single tree appeared to give us shelter
         from the scorching sun. I rewarded my friendly conductors with all the Taheitee cloth, and
         iron ware, which I had about me, and arrived safely on board with the party." </p>

      <p>From this narrative it is evident, that the most diligent enquiries on our part, have not
         been sufficient to throw a clear light on the surprising objects which struck our eyes in
         this island. We may however, attempt to account for those gigantic monuments, of which
         great numbers exist in every part; for as they are so disproportionate to the present
         strength of the nation, it is most reasonable to look upon them as the remains of better
         times. The nicest calculations which we could make, never brought the number of inhabitants
         in this island beyond seven hundred , who, destitute of tools, of shelter, and clothing,
         are obliged to spend all their time in providing food to support their precarious
         existence. It is obvious that they are too much occupied with their wants, to think of
         forming statues, which would cost them ages to finish, and require their united strength to
         erect. Accordingly, we did not see a single instrument among them on all our excursions,
         which could have been of the least use in masonry or sculpture. We neither met with any
         quarries, where they had recently dug the materials, nor with unfinished statues which we
         might have considered as the work of the present race. It is therefore probable, that these
         people were formerly more numerous, more opulent and happy, when they could spare
         sufficient time to flatter the vanity of their princes, by perpetuating their name by
         lasting monuments. The remains of plantations found on the summits of the hills, give
         strength and support to this conjecture. It is not in our power to determine by what
         various accidents a nation so flourishing, could be reduced in number, and degraded to its
         present indigence. But we are well convinced that many causes may produce this effect, and
         that the devastation which a volcano might make, is alone sufficient to heap a load of
         miseries on a people confined to so small a space. In fact, this island, which may perhaps,
         in remote ages, have been produced by a volcano, since all its minerals are merely
         volcanic, has at least in all likelihood been destroyed by its fire. All kinds of trees and
         plants, all domestic animals, nay a great part of the nation itself may have perished in
         the dreadful convulsion of nature: hunger and misery must have been but too powerful
         enemies to those who escaped the fire. We cannot well account for those little carved
         images which we saw among the natives, and the representation of a dancing woman's hand,
         which, as I have mentioned above, are made of wood, at present not to be met with upon the
         island. The only idea which offers itself, is that they were made long ago, and have been
         saved by accident or predilection, at the general catastrophe which seems to have happened.
         All the women whom we saw in different parts of the island, did not amount to thirty,
         though our people crossed it almost from one end to the other, without seeing the least
         probability that the women had retired to any secluded part. If there are really no more
         than thirty or forty women, among six or seven hundred men, the whole nation is in a fair
         way of becoming entirely extinct in a short space of time, unless all our physical
         principles on the plurality of husbands are erroneous. The greater part of the women whom
         we saw gave us no reason to suppose that they were accustomed to a single partner; on the
         contrary, they seemed habitually to have arrived at the spirit of Messalina, or of
         Cleopatra. But this disproportion is such a singular phӕnomenon in human nature, that we
         cannot without difficulty give credit to it, and would willingly lay hold of any argument
         which, though incumbered with difficulties, might restore the proportion between the sexes.
         It is true our party did not see any valley or secluded glen, to which the women might have
         confined themselves during our stay; but I must remind the reader of those caverns
         mentioned before, to which the natives always refused to admit us. The caverns of Iceland
         are spacious enough to contain several thousand inhabitants; and nothing is more probable
         than that, in a similar volcanic country, such caverns may afford room for a few hundreds.
         What reasons the Easter Islanders may have to be more jealous of their women than the
         Taheitians, we know not; but we are acquainted with the outrageous and wanton behaviour of
         the sailor, wherever he has so great a superiority over the Indian, as the Dutch and
         Spaniards must have had over the people of Easter Island. The principal objection against
         this supposition is, however, the small number of children which we saw, there being no
         reason to seclude them from our eyes, whatever might be thought necessary with regard to
         the women. In short, this matter must remain unascertained, and if, in fact, the number of
         women is inconsiderable, it must have been diminished by some extraordinary accident, which
         none but the natives could have explained; but, in all our doubts, our ignorance of their
         language prevented us from acquiring any information.</p>

      <p>The next morning we sent a boat ashore to take in some water, and the weather continuing
         calm, another went off to trade with the natives in order to encrease our little stock of
         potatoes. One of the natives likewise plied between the ship and the shore, bringing off
         potatoes and bananas in the patched canoe. In the mean while a smart shower falling on
         board the ship, enabled our people to collect a quantity of fresh water in the awnings and
         sails of the ship, which were spread to catch it. Another boat went off to the shore in the
         afternoon, but towards evening a faint breeze springing up, the ship fired a gun, in
         consequence of which the boat came on board, and we sailed N. W. by W. from Easter
         Island.</p>

      <p>We had been greatly disappointed in the expectation which we had formed of this island, as
         a place of refreshment. The only article of any importance was their sweet potatoes; but
         after we had regularly shared out all we had purchased, the common people had only a few
         scanty meals of them. As to the bananas, yams, and sugar-canes which we had bought, they
         were in such inconsiderable quantities, that they scarce deserve to be mentioned. All the
         fowls which we had obtained, and which, in general, were of a very small breed, did not
         amount to fifty; and even the quantity of water which we had filled was inconsiderable and
         ill tasted. However, this small supply was so seasonable, that it preserved us from the too
         violent attacks of the scurvy and bilious disorders, till we could reach a better place of
         refreshment. Indeed, when I consider the wretched situation of the inhabitants, I am
         surprised that they parted with a quantity of provisions to us, of which the cultivation
         must have cost them great pains and labour. The barren refractory soil of their island, the
         scarcity of domestic animals, and the want of boats and proper materials for fishing, all
         concur to render their means of subsistence extremely difficult and precarious. Yet the
         desire of possessing the new toys and curiosities which strangers bring among them, hurried
         them away, and prevented their reflecting on the urgency of their own most natural and
         unavoidable wants. In this, as in numberless other circumstances, they agree with the
         tribes who inhabit New Zeeland, the Friendly and the Society Islands, and who seem to have
         had one common origin with them. Their features are very similar, so that the general
         character may easily be distinguished. Their colour, a yellowish brown, most like the hue
         of the New Zeelanders; their art of puncturing, the use of the mulberry-bark for clothing,
         the predilection for red paint and red dresses, the shape and workmanship of their clubs,
         the mode of dressing their victuals, all form a strong resemblance to the natives of the
         islands above mentioned. We may add to these, the simplicity of their languages, that of
         Easter Island being a dialect which, in many respects, resembles that of New Zeeland,
         especially in the harshness of pronunciation and the use of gutturals, and yet in other
         instances, partakes of that of Taheitee. The monarchical government likewise strengthens
         the affinity between the Easter Islanders and the tropical tribes, its prerogatives being
         only varied according to the different degrees of fertility of the islands, and the
         opulence or luxury of the people. Easter Island, or, as the natives call it, Waihu, is so
         very barren, that the whole number of plants growing upon it does not exceed twenty
         species, of which far the greater part is cultivated ; though the space which the
         plantations occupy is inconsiderable, compared with that which lies waste. The soil is
         altogether stoney, and parched by the sun, and water is so scarce, that the inhabitants
         drink it out of wells which have a strong admixture of brine; nay, some of our people
         really saw them drink of the sea-water when they were thirsty. Their habit of body must, in
         some measure, be influenced by these circumstances; they are meagre, and their muscles hard
         and rigid; they live very frugally, and, in general, go almost wholly naked, only covering
         the head, which is the most sensible of heat, with feathered caps, and puncturing or
         daubing the rest with colours. Their ideas of decency are, of course, very different from
         those of nations who are accustomed to clothing. They cut short their hair and beards from
         motives of cleanliness, like the people of Tonga-Tabboo, but fortunately seemed to be less
         subject to leprous complaints. It is easy to conclude that the kind of such a people cannot
         have great and conspicuous advantages of the commonalty, nor did our party observe any
         thing of that kind. The religion of the Easter Islanders is still wholly unknown to us,
         because abstract ideas are not to be acquired in so short a time as our stay. The statues,
         which are erected in honour of their kings, have a great affinity to the wooden figures,
         called Tee, on the chief's maraïs or burying-places at Taheitee; but we could not possibly
         consider them as idols, though Roggewein's people would pass them for such upon us. The
         fires which the Dutch interpret as sacrifices, were only made use of by the natives to
         dress their meals; and though the Spaniards suspected them to be a kind of superstition,
         they were, perhaps. equally mistaken, because the scarcity of fuel obliged the inhabitants
         to be careful of it, and to prevent their provisions being uncovered after they had once
         been put under ground with heated stones.</p>

      <p>We are unacquainted with the amusements of the people of Easter Island, having never seen
         them engaged in any kind of diversion, nor taken notice of a single musical instrument
         among them. They cannot, however, be entire strangers to amusement, since Maròo-wahai, who
         slept on board, talked a great deal of dancing, as soon as we had quieted his fears with
         respect to the safety of his person. The disposition of these people is far from being
         warlike; their numbers are too inconsiderable, and their poverty too general, to create
         civil disturbances amongst them. It is equally improbable that they have foreign wars,
         since hitherto we know of no island near enough to admit of an intercourse between the
         inhabitants; neither could we obtain any intelligence from those of Easter Island upon the
         subject. This being premised, it is extraordinary that they should have different kinds of
         offensive weapons, and especially such as resemble those of the New Zeelanders; and we must
         add this circumstance to several others, which are inexplicable to us in their kind.</p>

      <p>Upon the whole, supposing Easter Island to have undergone a late misfortune from volcanic
         fires, its inhabitants are more to be pitied than any less civilized society, being
         acquainted with a number of conveniencies, comforts, and luxuries of life, which they
         formerly possessed, and of which the remembrance must embitter the loss. Mahine frequently
         lamented their unhappy situation, and seemed to feel for them more than he had done for the
         New Zeelanders, because he found them much more destitute. He added another stick to the
         bundle which composed his journal, and remembered Easter Island with this observation, tàta
         maïtaï, whennùa èeno, that the people were good, but the island very bad; whereas at New
         Zeeland he had found more fault with the natives than the country. His feelings were always
         warm from the heart, which education had filled with real philanthropy; they were likewise
         just, in general, because his senses were sound and acute, and his understanding, though
         uncultivated, was free from many prejudices.</p>

      <head>CHAP. V.</head>

      <p><date>[1774. March.][Thursday 17.]</date>THE breeze with which we sailed from Easter Island
         was so gentle, that we were still in sight of it the next day at noon, at the distance of
         fifteen leagues. The weather was rather sultry, and captain Cook relapsed into his former
         bilious disorder, by having exerted himself too much on shore, during the violent heat of
         noon. All those who had been on the long excursion across the island, had their faces
         blistered by the sun, and extremely painful in proportion as the skin peeled off. The short
         stay near the land, and the use of a few vegetables from thence, had greatly restored to
         their health those who were afflicted with the scurvy before; and several, though
         excessively weak, felt no inconvenience at present. It is true, the little supply at Easter
         Island served only as a whet to our appetite, and made us all extremely eager in our wishes
         of reaching the Marquesas of Mendoça, whither we now directed our course. Very fortunately
         for us the wind freshened the next day, and continued so for some time, giving life to our
         hopes, and inspiring more chearfulness than we had known for some months past.</p>

      <p>In a few days, however, we were much alarmed to find several people sickening again, and
         particularly complaining of constipations and bilious disorders, which are deadly in hot
         climates. Among these was our excellent surgeon himself, whose illness gave us more pain
         than almost any thing else. The most unlucky circumstance was, that the patients could not
         eat the potatoes which we had brought from the shore, because they were too flatulent for
         their weakened stomachs.</p>

      <p><date>[Thursday 24.]</date>A calm which happened on the 24th, our latitude being about 17°
         south, was very disagreeable to the sick, and brought some of them very low. Captain Cook
         himself was obliged to keep his bed again, being afflicted with some alarming symptoms.
         However the wind returned in the afternoon, and freshening considerably in a day or two,
         cooled the air very pleasantly. This weather was very salutary to all the bilious patients;
         so that they appeared on deck, and walked, or rather crawled about, though exceedingly
         emaciated.</p>

      <p>My father ordered his Taheitian dog, the only one which still remained alive after our
         departure from the Friendly Islands, to be killed; it was cut into quarters, which were
         served up to captain Cook during several days, and gave him some nourishment, as he could
         not venture to taste the ship's provisions. By such small helps we succeeded in preserving
         a life upon which the success of the voyage in a great measure depended.</p>

      <p>We daily saw Tropic birds and shearwaters after leaving Easter Island, and frightened many
         shoals of flying fish out of the water. These fish were remarkably numerous on
            <date>[Saturday 27.]</date>the 27th, when we saw none but small ones, the largest not
         exceeding the length of a finger, and the least scarcely so long as one of its joints. Our
         latitude that day, at noon, was 13° 13' south.</p>

      <p><date>[1774. April.]</date>Since the calm on the 24th we had a fine steady gale from the
         eastward, which speeded our course prodigiously. The weather in general was serene, and the
         colour of the ocean a fine rich blue, bearing always a considerable relation to that of the
         sky. Dolphins, bonitos, and sharks appeared from time to time, and various birds at war
         with flying fishes enlivened the scene. To add to our comfort, the heat of the sun became
         perfectly agreeable to us, being tempered by the rapid motion of the air, and permitted us
         to walk about the decks with some satisfaction. Nothing less was wanting to keep up our
         fainting spirits, and to strengthen the sick, who might be said to feed entirely upon hope,
         having no refreshments to restore their wasted strength. We had already consumed all the
         vegetables which had been purchased at Easter Island; nothing therefore remained, but
         either to return to the loathed diet of salted meat, of which the juices were utterly
         destroyed, by lying in pickle for three years, or to starve on a small quantity of bread,
         if the stomach could not digest those gross and unprofitable fibres. We were therefore
         unanimous in our wishes of a speedy deliverance; and in proportion as the breeze slackened
         or encreased, the thermometer of our expectations fluctuated from abject despondence to the
         most sanguine expectation. All our books which treated of Mendaça's Voyages were consulted;
         and since the vague expressions, relative to the distance of the Marquesas from Peru, gave
         us full scope for conjecture, every day produced a new calculation of their longitude. For
         the space of five days we successively passed over the different positions which our new
         geographers had allotted to those islands, and overturned each new hypothesis, not without
         some diversion to the rest, who either artfully concealed their own opinion, or candidly
         confessed that the data were too uncertain to bear a superstructure. During this course we
         enjoyed some beautiful evenings, and particularly observed the sky and clouds tinged with
         different hues of green by the setting sun, on the 3d of April. This colour has been
         observed by Frezier before, and is in fact nothing extraordinary, especially if the air
         happens to be charged with vapours, which is frequently the case between the tropics. The
         same day we had caught a small sucking fish, adhering to a flying fish, with which we had
         baited a hook: a proof that these little creatures are not always fixed to sharks. The same
         day we saw a large fish of the genus of rays, which is called a sea-devil by some authors.
         It perfectly resembled that which we had seen in the Atlantic, on the first of September,
         1772. (See vol. I. p. 47). The number of terns, tropic, and man of war birds, encreased
         around us almost every day, as we ran to the westward, and approached the islands which we
         expected to find. At last, on the 6th of April in the afternoon, we had sight of a small
         bluff island; but the haze which involved it, and which thickened as we advanced, prevented
         our examining the nature of the land, and building any hopes of refreshment on its
         appearance. Quiros, who is supposed to have written the account of the voyage of the
         Spanish Adelentado (or captain-general) Don Alvaro Mendaça de Neyra, in the year 1595,
         gives a favourable account of the group of islands discovered in that voyage, which were
         named the Islas Marquesas de Mendoça, in honour of the viceroy of Peru, Don Garcia Hurtado
         de Mendoça, marquis of Cañete, who had set on foot that expedition. We had recourse to this
         account, in order to gain some information relative to the land which now engrossed all our
         attention. <date>[Thursday 7.]</date>The next morning we stood in-shore, and though the
         weather still continued hazy, we soon distinguished the different islands which the
         Spaniards have called la Dominica, St. Pedro, and St. Christina. We were convinced at the
         same time, that the small bluff island which we had first fallen in with, had not been seen
         by Mendaça; and captain Cook gave it the name of Hood's Island, from the person who first
         discovered it. La Dominica, which lay nearest to us, was a high and mountainous island, of
         which the N. E. point was very steep and barren; but farther to the north we observed some
         vallies filled with trees, amongst which we now and then discovered a hut. As the haze
         cleared away, we saw many craggy rocks like spires, and several hollow summits piled up in
         the centre of the island, which proved that volcanoes and earthquakes had been active there
         in changing the face of the country. All its eastern part is a prodigious steep and almost
         perpendicular wall, of a great height, which forms a sharp ridge, shattered into spires and
         precipices. St. Pedro is a small island, of very moderate elevation, but did not appear
         either fertile or populous. St. Christina, the westermost of all, had the most promising
         appearance; and, though very high and steep, yet had several vallies, which widened towards
         the sea, and were covered with fine forests to the summits of the mountain. About three
         o'clock we entered the straits, between the south end of Dominica, and the N. E. part of
         St. Christina, which is above two miles wide. We observed some pleasant spots on both
         islands, between the clefts of the mountain; but saw no plains, like those which so greatly
         embellish the Society Islands. The shore of St. Christina was, however, sufficient to
         revive all our spirits, and inspired that cheerfulness which every fertile and pleasing
         prospect gives to the weary mariner. We passed several little coves, where the white
         foaming surf tumbled in upon the beach. The two projecting points of every cove included a
         valley, filled with forests and plantations, of a pleasing verdure. On every beach we saw
         some inhabitants running about, or gazing at our ship. Sometimes they launched their
         canoes, and attempted to come after us; but a strong breeze carried us so swiftly through
         the smooth water, that we left them far behind. We found a harbour on the west side of the
         island, which looked so tempting, that we eagerly wished to come to an anchor; but just as
         we were turning about, in order to run into it, a heavy squall came over the high mountain
         with prodigious violence, and laid the ship on her side, so that we sprung our
         mizen-topmast, and narrowly escaped being driven against the southern point of the harbour.
         After we had trimmed our sails again, we tacked, and anchored about five o'clock in the
         entrance of the harbour. During the squall, about fifteen canoes, putting off from
         different parts of the island, came near the ship. Some were double, and contained fifteen
         men; others, on the contrary, were small, and had from three to seven men. As soon as we
         were at anchor, we invited the natives, by every sign of friendship, and by addressing them
         in the Taheitian language, to come on board. This they did not venture to do; but at first
         they brought their canoes close alongside, and offered us some pepper-roots, which were
         doubtless signs of peace, as at the Society and Friendly Islands. After we had fastened
         these roots to the shrouds, they sold us a few fish in exchange for nails, and likewise
         some excellent large bread-fruit, perfectly ripe, at sight of which our whole ship's
         company expressed the greatest marks of joy in their countenances.</p>

      <p>The natives about us were a well-made, handsome people, of a good yellowish or tawny
         colour, but looked almost black, by being punctured over the whole body. They were all
         naked, having only a small piece of cloth, perfectly resembling that made by the people of
         Taheitee, round their waist and loins. Their beards and hair were of a fine jetty black,
         and their language much nearer the Taheitian, than any other dialect in the South Sea, with
         this difference, that they could not pronounce the r. Their canoes were thin, and formed of
         boards slightly sewed together, and their paddles were made like those of Taheitee, with a
         knob at the end. We continually enquired for hogs, and told them to bring us some; and
         towards night we had the satisfaction to see a pig along-side, which we purchased for a
         knife. As soon as it was dark, the canoes retired, according to the general custom of all
         the nations in the South Sea we had hitherto seen, on whom the novelty of an European ship
         cannot prevail to wake a single night. The vallies in our harbour were very full of trees,
         and every part answered the graphical description which the Spaniards have given, and by
         which we were well convinced that their harbour of Madre de Dios was the same where we had
         anchored . Its situation, deduced from astronomical observation, is in 9° 55' S. latitude,
         and 139° S. W. longitude. We saw many fires through the trees, at a great distance from the
         water, and concluded the country to be well inhabited. <date>[Friday 8.]</date>The next
         morning early we had a full view of the land, clear of the clouds which rested on it in the
         evening. On the south side rises a peak, which is very craggy and inaccessible. All the
         north side is a black, burnt hill, of which the rock is vaulted along the sea-shore, and
         the top clad to the summit with a shrubbery of casuarinas. But the bottom of the harbour is
         filled up with a very high ridge, level at top, and resembling the Table-mountain at the
         Cape of Good Hope. Several vallies, perfectly filled with trees, lead up from two beaches
         to the very summit of the mountain, which appears excessively steep. Along its uppermost
         edge we saw a row of stakes or pallisadoes, closely connected together, like a
         fortification, within which, by the help of our glasses, we discerned something like huts.
         These places we supposed to be what the Spaniards have called intrenchments; but they bore
         a great resemblance to the hippas of the New Zeelanders, which are commonly situated on
         high ridges, and surrounded with pallisades.</p>

      <p>The natives, encouraged by the trade which we had begun the evening before, came off in
         several canoes, soon after sun-rise, and brought great quantities of bread fruit, which we
         bought for small nails. They likewise sold some bananas, and traded very fair for some
         time, but without venturing to come on board. However, after breakfast, it appeared that
         their disposition had but too much similarity with that of the Taheitians. Some of them
         began to deal dishonestly with us, receiving the nail for which they had offered a
         bread-fruit, without delivering it in return. The captain, to intimidate them, fired a
         musket over their heads. This had the desired effect, and they immediately handed up the
         fruit for which we had bargained. Some others, after they had sold their goods, came on
         board to be gazed at, and to gaze. While captain Cook prepared to go into his boat with my
         father, one of these natives, finding the large iron stanchion loose, to which the
         man-ropes on the ship's side, by which we ascended or descended, were fastened, snatched it
         up, leaped overboard with it, and, notwithstanding its weight, swam with great agility to
         his canoe, where he secured it. This hazardous enterprize being reported to captain Cook,
         who was just stepping into the boat, he ordered a musket to be fired over the native's
         head, whilst he meant to come round the ship, to recover the stanchion. The musket was
         fired, but the man took no notice of it, looking about him with great unconcern. The
         captain hearing it, ordered another to be fired, and put off from the ship. The second shot
         had no other effect than the first; upon which an officer, who that moment came upon deck,
         snatched up a musket, and taking exact aim, shot the man through the head. His companion in
         the same canoe instantly threw the iron into the sea, which had been the cause of this
         unfortunate event. The captain in his boat came up, and saw the canoe full of blood, and
         the dead corse lying in it. The other native baled the blood out into the sea, and then
         retired to the shore with all the other canoes, and left us perfectly alone. The natives on
         the beach hauled the canoe through the surf, and carried the corse up into the woods.
         Presently after we heard drums beating, and saw a considerable number of the inhabitants
         assembled on the beach, with spears and clubs in their hands, which had a very unfriendly
         appearance, and rather seemed to threaten that we had no farther refreshments to expect. We
         cannot but lament, that the time in which this man was killed, by a person who was ignorant
         of the nature of his offence, did not admit of any previous consideration. The first
         discoverers and conquerors of America have often, and very deservedly, been stigmatised
         with cruelty, because they treated the wretched nations of that continent, not as their
         brethren, but as irrational beasts, whom it was lawful to shoot for diversion; and yet, in
         our enlightened age, prejudice and rashness have often proved fatal to the inhabitants of
         the South Sea. Mahine burst into tears, when he saw one man killing another on so trifling
         an occasion. Let his feelings put those civilized Europeans to the blush, who have humanity
         so often on their lips, and so seldom in their hearts!</p>

      <p>Captain Cook, knowing the weak condition of his crew, was unwilling to relinquish the hope
         of procuring refreshments at this island; and therefore, after directing the ship to be
         removed deeper into the harbour, selected a party of marines and sailors, and landed under
         the vaulted rocks to the northward, accompanied by Dr. Sparrman, Mahine, my father, and
         myself. A great troop of the natives, consisting of more than a hundred men, received us on
         these rocks with spears and clubs in their hands, of which they did not attempt to make any
         use. We approached them with demonstrations of friendship, which they returned; and our
         first request was that they should sit down, to which they instantly agreed. We then
         endeavoured to shew the best side of what had happened, and acquainted them that we had
         only shot at one of their countrymen, because he had made free with our property; that we
         were desirous of living as friends with them; and that we only came to take in wood, water,
         and refreshments, for which we had nails, hatchets, and other curious articles to offer in
         return. The natives were pacified by our specious reasonings; they seemed to think their
         countryman had deserved his fate, and conducted us round the beach to a fine brook, where
         we established our waterers, and began to purchase some fruits, which were at first brought
         down very sparingly. For greater security, the marines were drawn up in a line, under arms,
         and our return to the water secured. But we had no occasion for these precautions; the
         people with whom we dealt were too honest to break a peace to which they had consented, and
         of too gentle a disposition to revenge the death of a man whom they could not entirely
         acquit. In a short time our trade went on more briskly, and the natives came down with
         loads of plantanes, bananas, and bread-fruit from the hills, which they sold for a trifling
         consideration of iron ware. </p>

      <p>Among the croud we saw no women, they having probably retired to the mountains on the first
         alarm; but there were some men better armed and ornamented than the rest, who seemed to be
         their leaders. They were all without cloathing, having nothing but a small piece of cloth
         to cover the loins. They were tall, and extremely well limbed; not one of them unweildly or
         corpulent like a Taheitian, nor meagre and shrivelled like a native of Easter Island. The
         punctuation which almost entirely covered the men of a middle age, made it difficult to
         distinguish their elegance of form; but among the youths, who were not yet marked or
         tattowed, it was easy to discover beauties singularly striking, and often without a
         blemish, such as demanded the admiration of all beholders. Many of them might be placed
         near the famous models of antiquity, and would not suffer in the comparison:</p>

      <p>The natural colour of these youths was not quite so dark as that of the common people in
         the Society Isles; but the men appeared to be infinitely blacker, on account of the
         punctures which covered their whole body, from head to foot. These punctures were disposed
         with the utmost regularity; so that the marks on each leg, arm, and cheek, and on the
         corresponding muscles, were exactly similar. They never assumed the determinate form of an
         animal or plant, but consisted of a variety of blotches, spirals, bars, chequers, and
         lines, which had a most motley appearance. Their countenances were pleasing, open, and full
         of vivacity; their eyes were large and dark-coloured; their hair black, curled, and strong;
         a few excepted, who had light-coloured or sandy hair. The beard however was thin in
         general, on account of the numerous scars of punctures which commonly covered that part of
         the face. The number of ornaments, in some measure, might be said to supply the want of
         cloathing. On their heads many of them wore a kind of diadem; this consisted of a flat
         bandage wrought of coco-nut core, on the outside of which several round pieces of mother of
         pearl, some of them five inches in diameter, were fixed, covered in the middle with a plate
         of tortoise-shell, perforated like fret-work. Several tufts of long, black, and glossy
         cock's feathers formed the plumes to this head-dress, which was really beautiful and noble
         in its kind. Some wore round coronets of the small ligulated feathers of the man of war
         bird, and others a circle, from whence several ranges of twisted strings of coco-nut core,
         about two inches long, either of the natural colour, or dyed black, diverged round the
         head. In their ears they sometimes placed two flat pieces of a light wood, of an oval
         shape, about three inches long, covering the whole ear, and painted them white with lime.
         Their leaders wore a kind of gorget round the neck, or rather on the breast; it consisted
         of small portions of a light wood, like cork, glued together with gum, in a semicircular
         form; a quantity of scarlet-beans (abrus precatorius, Linn.) are glued all round it with
         the same gum, forming a great number of rows, of the length of two or three inches. Those
         who were not possessed of this glaring ornament, at least wore a string round the neck, and
         fastened it to a piece of shell, which was cut and polished in the shape of a large tooth.
         They were also fond of having bunches of human hair tied on a string round their waist,
         arms, knees, and ancles. All these ornaments they freely parted with for a trifling
         consideration, except the last, which they valued very highly, though they were the usual
         residence of many vermin. It is probable that these bunches of hair were worn in
         remembrance of their dead relations, and therefore looked upon with some veneration; or
         else they may be the spoils of their enemies, worn as the honourable testimonies of
         victory. However a large nail, or something which struck their eyes, commonly got the
         better of their scruples.</p>

      <p>After we had made these observations on the people who surrounded us, we left the beach,
         and rambled through the woods at a short distance from captain Cook's station, collecting
         several plants, of which we had seen the greatest part at the Society Islands. As we did
         not care to advance far into the country the first day, we confined ourselves to the low
         land, which bordered upon the beach, and which we found entirely uninhabited. However we
         met with a number of square compartments among the trees, laid out with great stones,
         mostly of a regular square figure; which we afterwards learnt, were the foundations of
         their houses. It may be conjectured from thence, that these places have been abandoned, on
         account of some inconvenience of the ground; or that they are only made use of at certain
         seasons. All this part was destitute of plantations, and covered with forest-trees, some of
         which seemed to be very good timber. The natives did not attempt to stop us, and left us to
         pursue our walk entirely by ourselves. A little hill, covered with long grass up to our
         middle, and broken into a perpendicular wall to the sea, juts forward, and divides this
         beach from another to the southward. On the north side of this hill we found a fine spring
         of clear water, in the very place where the Spanish navigators have described it, which
         gushes out of the rock, and is collected in a little bason, from whence it flows into the
         sea. A brook runs down from the higher hills close to it; another more considerable
         descends on the middle of the beach, and supplied us with water; and again another is to be
         met with in the northern corner. This island is therefore extremely well watered; and the
         vegetation, as well as the inhabitants, evidently derive great benefit from it in this hot
         climate. We soon returned to the trading place with our acquisitions, and conversed with
         the natives, who had now so far laid aside their distrust, as to part with their arms to us
         for our iron tools. These weapons were all made of the club-wood, or casuarina , and were
         either plain spears, about eight or ten feet long, or clubs, which commonly had a large
         knob at one end. Captain Cook had been very successful in the meanwhile, having procured a
         great quantity of fruit and several hogs, with all which we embarked in our boats at noon.
         The weather which had been very warm on shore, was really much cooler on board, where the
         wind came down in strong gusts from the mountains, sometimes attended with small
         showers.</p>

      <p>In the afternoon I remained on board, but my father accompanied the captain on shore, and
         went up the hill a little way to a wretched hut; but finding no inhabitants there, who had
         probably been alarmed by their shooting at birds, he put several nails on a few
         bread-fruit, which he saw close to the hut, and then descended to the beach with some
         botanical acquisitions.</p>

      <p><date>[Saturday 9.]</date>Seven canoes arrived about the ship from La Dominica the next
         morning, whilst several others from St. Christina went up the strait. The former seemed to
         be of the same nation with those with whom we were already acquainted, and brought the same
         fruits to sell, which we had purchased in this island. We went on shore after breakfast,
         and found our friendly natives assembled on the beach. Among them was a chief, who was
         dressed in a cloak manufactured of the paper-mulberry bark, like the Taheitian cloth, and
         who wore the diadem, the gorget, the ear-pendants, and bunches of hair. We learnt that this
         man was the king of the whole island, though he had not great respect shewn him. He
         presented captain Cook with some fruits and hogs, and continued in the neighbourhood of our
         people the whole day. He acquainted us that his name was Hònoo , and that he was he-ka-aï,
         which was doubtless a title corresponding to the aree of Taheitee, and areekee of the
         Friendly Islands. He seemed to be a very good-natured, intelligent man, a character so
         prevalent in his countenance, that Mr. Hodges, who drew his picture, could not fail of
         expressing it, as may be seen in the print of him, in captain Cook's account of this
         voyage. We enquired for the name of this island and the adjacent ones, and found that St.
         Christina was called Waitahoo, La Dominica Heevaroa, and St. Pedro Onateyo. Mahine, who was
         excessively fond of these people, on account of the vast similarity between their manners,
         language and persons, and those of his nation, was continually engaged in conversation with
         them, and purchased a great number of their ornaments. He shewed them many customs of his
         country, with which they were unacquainted, and among these was the method of lighting a
         fire, by rubbing together the dry sticks of the hibiscus tiliaceus, to which they were
         extremely attentive. Captain Cook found a great quantity of vegetables, some fowls and
         hogs, at the trading place, which he purchased for small nails, knives, pieces of cloth,
         &amp;c. The red feathers of Tonga-Tabboo or Amsterdam Island, were likewise in great repute
         here, and the natives gave many head-dresses, and other ornaments, in exchange for them. We
         saw only one woman this day, who sat down in the circle of her countrymen, and was dressed
         in a piece of cloth made of bark, like the women of the Society Islands. She was an elderly
         woman, and scarce distinguishable from a Taheitian. We walked this day about a mile and a
         half, on the south side of the rivulet. After crossing a clear spot, some whence we had a
         full prospect of the harbour, we entered a thick wood, where we saw chiefly the ratta, or
         Taheitee nuttrees (inocarpus ) which grew to a considerable size and height, and some fine
         bread-fruit trees; both which are planted in the plains at Taheitee, the heat being less
         violent there than at these islands. At last we came to one of the huts of the natives,
         which, in comparison with the lofty houses of the Society Islands, was only a wretched
         hovel. It was placed on an elevated platform of stones, which were not smooth and even
         enough to form a very comfortable couch, though they were covered with mats. On this base
         the natives had erected a quantity of bamboo-canes, closely connected together, between
         five and six feet high, above which the roof rose in a ridge at top, consisting of small
         sticks, thatched with the leaves of the bread-fruit and ratta tree. The whole house might
         be about fifteen feet long, and eight or ten feet broad, and the method of placing it on a
         foundation of stones, seemed to intimate that the country is subject to heavy rains and
         inundations at certain seasons. We saw some large wooden troughs here, and found pieces of
         bread-fruit, mixed with water, in them. Three natives appeared near the hut, who, at our
         desire, went down about a hundred yards to the brook, and brought us some fresh water to
         drink. Having rewarded them for their readiness to serve us, we walked to the beach, and
         from thence returned on board. In getting into our boat, we ran the greatest risk in the
         world of being overset, and were wetted by the surf, which broke upon the rocks. Mahine,
         who still remained on shore, plunged into the water, and swam to the boat, to prevent our
         exposing ourselves once more to the same danger in taking him in.</p>

      <p>Dr. Sparrman staid on board with me in the afternoon, describing and drawing some plants
         which we had collected in the morning; but my father returned ashore with the captain to
         the southern beach, where he found several habitations near the sea, but saw no women. This
         was the same beach to which the natives had carried the dead body of their countryman. They
         were conducted to a house, which had been that unfortunate man's dwelling, and saw several
         hogs there, now the property of his son, a youth of fifteen years, to whom they made
         several expiatory presents. Our people enquired for his female relations, but were told
         they remained on the top of the mountain, to weep and mourn for the dead. We had some
         reason to suspect, from this account, that the pallisades or enclosures along the top of
         the rock, surrounded the burying-places of the inhabitants. The captain purchased a
         quantity of fruit, and several hogs, at this beach; and though he was in the midst of the
         relations of a man whom our people had killed, he did not perceive the least animosity or
         spirit of revenge amongst them.</p>

      <p>The next morning Dr. Sparrman went on shore with me to the watering place, where the trade
         for provisions was very considerable. Our iron ware was however lowered in value at least
         two hundred per cent. since our anchorage in the harbour. Our small nails, which they had
         eagerly taken at first, were now no longer current; and even the large ones were not much
         coveted. Beads were not esteemed at all; but ribbons, cloth, and other trifles were more
         agreeable. Some large hogs were purchased for pieces of the mulberry-bark, covered with red
         feathers, which we had obtained at the island of Amsterdam or Tonga-Tabboo.</p>

      <p>The weather was exceedingly hot this day, for which reason many of the inhabitants made use
         of large fans to cool themselves. These fans, of which they sold us a great number, were
         formed of a kind of tough bark or grass, very firmly and curiously plaited, and frequently
         whitened with shell-lime. Some also had large feathered leaves, which answered the purpose
         of an umbrella, and upon examination, were found to belong to the corypha umbraculi-fera,
         Linn. a kind of palm. The fans are represented on a reduced scale on the same plate, with
         the head-dresses of these people, and inserted in captain Cook's account of this
         voyage.</p>

      <p>Notwithstanding the immense heat of the day, we resolved to ascend the mountain, in hopes
         of being well rewarded for the trouble, by the discoveries we should make. The pallisades
         at the top were particularly what we aimed at, none of our people having hitherto any idea
         of them. Mr. Patton and two other gentlemen were of the party. We soon crossed the fine
         rivulet, at which our people watered, and followed the path on the north side, seeing that
         the greatest number of inhabitants had come down from thence. The ascent was at first not
         very fatiguing; several gentle hills formed the fore-ground, which were almost level on the
         summits, and contained several spacious plantations of bananas, in excellent order. These
         spots always opened upon us unexpectedly, as the rest of our way lay through a close tufted
         wood of fruit-trees, mixed with other sorts, extremely pleasant to us, on account of the
         thick and cooling shade. Here and there we met with a solitary coco-nut palm, which, far
         from lifting its royal head with becoming pride, was out-topped and hid by meaner trees. In
         general these trees do not thrive well upon mountains, preferring a low situation; insomuch
         that they abound upon the coral-ledges, where they have scarcely soil sufficient to take
         root. A few natives accompanied us, and some others met us with fruit, which they carried
         to our trading place. In proportion as we ascended, we passed a number of their houses,
         which were all built upon an elevated base of stones, and exactly upon the plan of that
         which I have described, page 21. some of them seemed to be very lately built, and looked
         very clean within; but we could not distinguish the number of beds in them, of which the
         Spaniards make mention, and suspected that they only meant different mats spread on the
         floor. The ground became much steeper and rugged as we advanced. The rivulet frequently ran
         in a deep glen, on the brink of which the path was rather dangerous. We were likewise
         obliged to cross the water several times in our way; but always found the habitations more
         numerous towards the top. We rested in several places, and were presented with fruit and a
         little water by the natives, who resembled the Taheitians too much in other respects, to be
         unlike them in hospitality. We never saw a single deformed, nor even ill-proportioned man
         among them; all were strong, tall, well-limbed, and active in the greatest degree. The
         nature of their country contributes towards their activity; and the exercise which they are
         obliged to take, probably preserves their elegance of form. Having advanced near three
         miles from the sea side, we saw a young woman, who came out of a house before us, and
         hastened up the hills as fast as we advanced. She was dressed in a piece of cloth, made of
         the mulberry-tree's bark, and reaching to the knees. Her features were like those of the
         Taheitee women, as far as we could discern at the distance of thirty yards, which she took
         care to preserve between herself and us, and her stature was middle sized. The natives made
         many signs to us to return, and seemed to be very uneasy and much displeased at our
         progress. Dr. Sparrman and myself, desirous of preserving the plants which we had
         collected, turned back, whilst Mr. Patton and the rest went on about two miles farther,
         without seeing any thing more than ourselves. We were the more easily persuaded to desist
         from our purpose, as the heat of the day, our precarious state of health, and the fatigue
         of the ascent, had entirely exhausted us, and as we saw no prospect of reaching the summit.
         It appeared indeed at least three miles distant from the place where we stopped, the
         greatest part of which seemed to be infinitely steeper than what we had hitherto left
         behind us. The whole ground, as far as we had gone, was covered with a rich mould, and
         contained excellent plantations, and groves of various fruit-trees. The rocks under this
         mould, which appeared chiefly near the banks of the rivulet, or on the broken sides of the
         path, contained volcanic productions, or different kinds of lava, some of which are full of
         white and greenish sherls. These islands are therefore similar, in regard to their origin
         and the nature of their minerals, to the Society Islands, the greater part of which seem to
         have had burning mountains. About the houses we frequently saw hogs, and fowls of a large
         sort, and now and then some rats. The trees were likewise inhabited by several small birds,
         which resembled those of Taheitee and the Society Islands; but they were not frequent, and
         in no great variety. The Marquesas, upon the whole, so much resemble the Society Islands,
         that they only seemed to want the beautiful ambient plain, and the coral reef, which forms
         their excellent harbours. No people in the South Sea, whom we had hitherto met with, were
         so much like each other in form, customs, and language, as the inhabitants of both these
         groups of islands. The principal difference seemed to lie in the different degrees of
         cleanliness. The Taheitians, and their next neighbours of the Society Islands, are perhaps
         the cleanliest people under the sun; they bathe two or three times a day, and wash their
         hands and face before and after every meal. The inhabitants of the Marquesas did not make
         their ablutions so frequently, and were besides very slovenly in the manner of preparing
         their meals. Their principal food is bread-fruit, which they roast over the fire, rarely
         baking it under ground; when it is sufficiently done, they put it into a very dirty wooden
         trough, out of which their hogs are fed at other times, and mix it up with water. This
         mixture they scoop out with their hands. They also prepare fermented paste from their
         bread-fruit, of which they make the same kind of acidulous pottage, which is a great dainty
         with the Taheitian chiefs. Their bread-fruit is doubtless the largest and most delicious
         which we ever tasted; and as we bought many of them perfectly ripe, we found them as soft
         as a kind of custard, and in that state too luscious to be eaten. Their food consists of
         the same variety of fruit and roots which are common at Taheitee, except the apple
         (spondias). Their diet is chiefly vegetable; though they have hogs and fowls, and catch
         abundance of fish at certain times. Their drink is purely water, since coco-nuts are
         scarce, at least in the parts which we visited. It is however to be suspected, that since
         they have the pepper-root, and make use of it as a sign of peace, like the other islanders,
         they may also prepare the same dainty beverage from it, with which the others intoxicate
         themselves. They are peculiarly cleanly in regard to the egesta. At the Society Islands the
         wanderer's eyes and nose are offended every morning, in the midst of a path, with the
         natural effects of a sound digestion: but the natives of the Marquesas are accustomed,
         after the manner of our cats, to bury the offensive objects in the earth. At Taheitee,
         indeed, they depend on the friendly assistance of rats, who greedily devour these
         odoriferous dainties; nay they seemed to be convinced that their custom is the most proper
         in the world; for their witty countryman, Tupaya (Tupia), found fault with our want of
         delicacy, when he saw a little building, appropriated to the rites of Cloacina, in every
         house at Batavia.</p>

      <p>We hastened down to the sea-side, in order to reach it before our boats put off. When we
         came to the ship, we found it surrounded with canoes from different parts, who brought
         several hogs and plenty of bananas for sale. The alarm which our unfortunate act of
         violence had spread among the natives on the first day, was now forgotten, and they came
         into the ship in great numbers, conversing familiarly with our people, and expressing great
         satisfaction at every thing which they saw. They had even so far laid aside all thoughts of
         what had happened, that many began to pilfer again, as often as an opportunity offered;
         however, if they were detected, they never failed to return very quietly what they had
         taken. They frequently danced upon the decks, for the diversion of our sailors; and in
         these dances we observed a striking resemblance with those of Taheitee. It appeared
         likewise that their music was nearly the same, especially as they had the same kind of
         drums, of which Mahine purchased one. Their canoes were likewise very similar to those of
         Taheitee, but of not great size. The heads commonly had some flat upright piece, on which
         the human face was coarsely carved; and their sails were made of mats, triangular, and very
         broad at the top. The paddles which they used were made of a heavy hard wood, short, but
         sharp-pointed, and with a knob at the upper end.</p>

      <p>I staid on board in the afternoon, and ranged the collections which we had hitherto made.
         In the evening, captain Cook, with some officers, Mr. Hodges, Dr. Sparrman, and my father,
         returned on board, having been out all the afternoon to visit two coves to the south of our
         harbour. They found these places extremely open, and exposed to the sea, and run great risk
         in landing and embarking, on account of the prodigious surf on the beach. They met with
         abundance of refreshments for their pains, and purchased several hogs. The natives were
         less reserved in both places than in our harbour, and a considerable number of women
         appeared among them, with whom the boat's crew soon became acquainted, since several of
         them had as much complaisance as certain ladies at the Society and Friendly Islands, New
         Zeeland, and Easter Island. They were inferior to the men in stature, but well
         proportioned, and some in feature approached the pleasing contour of the Taheitian women of
         quality. Their general colour was the same as among the common people of the Society
         Islands, and only very few were a little fairer than the rest. No punctures were observed
         on them, though the other sex are so much accustomed to disfigure themselves with this
         unsightly ornament. One of the handsomest consented to be drawn by Mr. Hodges, and an exact
         engraving, made from his drawing, is inserted in captain Cook's account of this voyage. All
         the women wore pieces of cloth of the mulberry bark, of different sorts; but the variety of
         these cloths was very trifling, compared with what it is at Taheitee; and it seemed the
         quantity was likewise inconsiderable, for, instead of being wrapped up in that number of
         pieces, so common among the luxurious chiefs of that island, they only wore a single ahòw
         or cloak, which covered them from the shoulders to the knees. Round their necks they
         sometimes had a few loose strings, which were not very ornamental; but our people took
         notice of no other finery among them. After a short stay, our party prepared to return to
         their boat. One of the sailors, having been inattentive to his duty, received several blows
         from the captain. This trifling circumstance would not deserve a place in this narrative,
         but for the observation, which the natives made upon it. As soon as they saw it, they
         shewed it one to another, and exclaimed tapè a-hai te tina, " he beats his brother." We
         were well convinced from other instances that they knew the difference between the
         commander and his people; but it appeared at the same time, that they looked upon us all as
         brethren. The most natural inference in my mind is, that they only applied an idea to us in
         this case, which really exists with regard to themselves. They probably look on themselves
         as one family, of which the eldest born is the chief or king. As their community is not yet
         arrived at that degree of civilization which the Taheitians enjoy, a difference of rank
         does not take place among them and their political constitution has not acquired a settled
         monarchical form. The nature of their country, which requires a greater labour and culture
         than Taheitee, is one great cause of this difference; for since the means of subsistence
         are not so easily attained, the population and the general luxury, cannot be so
         considerable, and the people remain upon a level. Agreeable to this observation, we have
         found that no particular honour or respect was paid to their king Honoo, who visited us on
         the second day after our arrival. All his pre-eminence seemed to consist in his dress,
         which was more complete than that of many of his people, who by choice, or through
         indolence, go naked in a happy tropical climate, where cloathing is not wanted.</p>

      <p><date>[Monday 11.]</date>The next morning the captain went to the same cove again, but was
         much less successful than on the preceding evening. The natives, who were not yet
         sufficiently acquainted with the excellence and durability of our iron ware, refused to
         take it any longer, and coveted a number of articles, which it was not in our power to part
         with. In the afternoon, therefore, we weighed the anchor, and stood out of the harbour of
         Madre de Dios, where we had lain something less than four days. We had provided a
         considerable quantity of excellent water during that time, and obtained a very salutary
         supply of refreshments from a friendly and well-disposed people. Our acquisitions in
         natural history had been but inconsiderable, from the great similarity of this island to
         Taheitee and the adjacent group, and on account of our very short stay. The same causes had
         likewise prevented our forming a more perfect acquaintance with the natives, who seemed to
         be well worth the contemplation of philosophic travellers. We particularly regretted, that
         it had not been in our power to examine those enclosures on the summits of the mountain,
         which, as I still suspect, have some connection with their religious rites. The Spaniards
         make mention of an oracle , which, from their accounts, seems to have been a burying place,
         like those of the Society Islands; but we were likewise unfortunate enough not to meet with
         any thing of this kind. The number of these good people cannot be very considerable, on
         account of the small size of the islands which they inhabit. Waitahoo , or St. Christina,
         is about eight leagues in circuit; O-Heeva-roa , or Dominica, fifteen leagues; Onateyo, or
         St. Pedro, three leagues; and Magdalena, which we only saw at a great distance, five
         leagues, according to the Spanish account. The natives of these different islands, we have
         great reason to believe, are all of one of the same tribe, like the people of Taheitee and
         the Society Isles; we may at least affirm it with certainty of those of St. Christina and
         Dominica, having conversed and traded with both. The island of Dominica, the largest of the
         Marquesas, is so excessively steep and craggy in many parts, that its inhabitants cannot be
         so numerous as those of St. Christina in proportion to its size. Such spots as are fit for
         culture are very populous in these islands; but as they are all very mountainous, and have
         many inaccessible and barren rocks, it is to be doubted whether the whole population of
         this group amounts to fifty thousand persons. The Spaniards, who discovered them, found
         their manners gentle and inoffensive, if we except a trifling difference at Magdalena,
         which probably arose from some misunderstanding, or from the impetuous temper of those
         navigators. When we arrived amongst them, we were received with every mark of friendship.
         They presented us with roots of pepper, and branches of tamannoo (calophyllum inophyllum,
         Linn.) in sign of peace; they sold us their provisions; and though we killed one of their
         brethren, they continued the same kind treatment, and permitted us to roam about their
         country to a great distance without molestation. This behaviour, their manners, their
         beautiful forms, their dresses, provisions, embarkations, and their language, prove that
         they have the same origin with the Taheitians, and only differ from them in a few respects,
         which the nature of their country required. The advantages which the rich encircling plains
         bestow on the Taheitians and their near neighbours, must drop in great measure at the
         Marquesas. When they have cultivated as much ground as will afford them the means of
         subsistence, there is none remaining for those extensive plantations of mulberry-trees,
         which every where strike the eye at Taheitee: indeed if they had the ground, they cannot
         afford to bestow the time which this branch of culture requires. The great sources of
         Taheitian affluence and luxury, their profusion of food, and their vast variety and
         quantity of cloth, do not exist in the Marquesas: but the inhabitants have a competence;
         they are all equal among themselves; they are active, very healthy, and beautifully made;
         there is nothing which can make them unhappy, by debarring them the means of obeying
         nature's voice. The Taheitians have more comforts and conveniencies; they have perhaps
         superior skill in the arts, and these things give them a greater relish for the enjoyment
         of life; but to balance these advantages, they are no longer upon a level; one part lives
         by the labours of the other, and diseases already wait upon their excesses.</p>

      <p>The fruits and fresh meat which we obtained at the Marquesas, may be considered as the
         first restoratives after a cruize of four months and a half; during which we visited the
         frozen zone to 71 deg. and the torrid to 9 1/2 deg. S. latitude. The small supply of
         potatoes at Easter Island was only a medicine, which providentially stopped the rapid
         progress of various diseases on board, but could not prevent their return, when we
         approached the torrid zone; whose active heat set our stagnant and putrid blood into a
         state fermentation. The wan look of all on board sufficiently proved, that our meeting with
         the Marquesas prevented a fatal and general attack of noxious distempers, which would have
         found us an easy prey, and might, in a short space of time, have made great havock in our
         ship. It must be allowed, at the same time, that, as far as human art, and a humane
         beneficent disposition will go, our worthy surgeon, Mr. Patton , took the best precautions
         possible to preserve the healths of all on board, by suggesting the proper methods to
         captain Cook, and by watching over us with unremitted assiduity. I will venture to affirm,
         that it is to him alone, under Providence, that many of us are indebted for our lives; and
         that his country owes him the preservation of those valuable and useful members of the
         commonwealth, who were sent out on this dangerous expedition. Great commendations are
         likewise due to captain Cook, who left no experiment untried which was proposed to him, and
         which seemed to promise success. The fate of the voyage depended upon the health of the
         crew, and he had the more merit in taking his measures agreeably to this reflection, since,
         however obvious it may seem, it has seldom guided other naval commanders.</p>

      <p>The short stay at the Marquesas had not been sufficient to restore our patients to perfect
         health, and those who had the bilious cholic were rather worse than before, having ventured
         to eat flatulent fruits, which were extremely dangerous in a weak stomach. Captain Cook
         himself was far from being recovered; for though he had experienced the bad effects of
         exposing himself to the burning rays of the sun at Easter Islands, he had been active all
         the time, in purchasing provisions, and superintending his people on shore. The effort
         which I had made in climbing the mountain, had likewise been too violent for my precarious
         state of health, and threw me into a dangerous bilious disorder, which was the more
         mortifying, as it happened just at a time, when the scene for my occupations was to
         open.</p>

      <p>We steered S. S. W. from St. Christina, and afterwards changed the course to S. W. and W.
         1/2°S. bringing to, every night, for greater safety, as we were now very near the
         archipelago of low islands, which had always been looked upon as a very intricate part of
         the Pacific Ocean. The Dutch navigators, in particular, have given an unfavourable idea of
         it; for Schouten calls it the Bad Sea, and Roggewein the Labyrinth. The latter lost one of
         his ships, the African Galley, on a low island, which, from that unfortunate accident, he
         called Pernicious Island. This circumstance having happened within the memory of man, is
         known among the Society Isles; from whence we may conclude, that Pernicious Island cannot
         be at a great distance from that group.</p>

      <p><date>[Sunday 17.]</date>On the 17th we discovered a low island, about ten o'clock in the
         morning, and coming up with it about noon, we were convinced, from the perspicuity of Mr.
         Byron's description, that it was the eastermost of King George's Islands. We were also
         confirmed in this belief towards night, when we perceived the other island, which he
         comprehended under that name. The island before us was extremely low and sandy, and formed
         an elliptic rocky ledge, no less than six leagues in its longest diameter, from north to
         south. Its latitude is 14° 28' S. and its longitude 144° 56' W. From space to space it was
         covered with coco-nut trees in great numbers, which had a pleasing airy look. Various trees
         and shrubberies sometimes concealed the stems of these palms to a great part of their
         height, but their beautiful crown always towered above the rest. The intervals between
         these green spots were so low, that the sea washed over them into the lagoon within. The
         stillness of the water, confined by the ledge of rocks, and its milky hue where it was
         shallow, contrasted very agreeably with the ruffled surface of the berylline unfathomable
         ocean. We sailed close along the western side of the island in the afternoon, and observed
         the rocks to be tinged with a fine scarlet colour in many places, exactly as Mr. Byron had
         found them. Several canoes sailing in the lagoon, smokes rising up between the clumps of
         trees, and armed men of a dark hue running along shore, were objects which greatly
         encreased the pleasure of the prospect. We likewise perceived women retiring to a remote
         part of the ledge, with bundles on their backs; an evident sign that they expected no good
         from our appearance on their coast. Indeed, having had the misfortune to lose some of their
         countrymen in opposing Mr. Byron's boats, and having been expelled from their habitation
         during a whole day by his people, who lived at discretion on their coco-nuts, it is not
         surprising that they secured their small possessions against the invasion of people who
         looked so like their enemies. Towards the S. W. end of the island we perceived the passage
         into the lagoon, which Mr. Byron mentions, and sent a boat to sound in its entrance,
         because at that time we were not yet acquainted with his ill success in the same attempt.
         Our people found a bottom of sharp corals, which made it impracticable for the ship to
         anchor. The natives, who were assembled in arms on the north point of the passage, behaved
         very quietly, and brought some coco-nuts, which were exchanged for nails. Upon this
         information, another boat was hoisted out, and both sent to the shore again, in order to
         trade with the natives, and to efface the sinister ideas which they seemed to have
         conceived of us at first. My father, Dr. Sparrman, and myself were of the party; though I
         was extremely ill of a bilious complaint. We landed without any opposition, and immediately
         mixed among the natives, of whom there seemed to be about fifty or sixty. They were all a
         set of stout men, of a dark brown, and had some punctures on the breast, belly, and hands,
         chiefly in imitation of fishes, which furnish a great part of their food. Their features
         were not disagreeable, but more mild than those of the natives of all the high islands
         about them. They went perfectly naked, having only a very small piece of cloth about their
         loins. Their women did not come near us; but those whom we saw at a distance had the same
         colour as the men, and their piece of cloth was enlarged to the size of a short apron. The
         hair and beards were generally black and curling, but sometimes cut; however I took notice
         of a single man, whose hair was quite yellowish at the points. As soon as we landed they
         embraced us, touching our noses, after the custom of New Zeeland, and began to bring
         coco-nuts and dogs for sale to the boats. Mahine, who was with us, purchased several dogs
         for small nails, and some for ripe bananas, which he had brought from the Marquesas. This
         fruit was much valued by the people of the low island, who immediately knew it; it should
         seem therefore that they have some acquaintance with the high islands, since bananas never
         grow upon their barren coral-ledges. The dogs were not unlike those at the Society Islands,
         but had fine long hair of a white colour. Mahine therefore was eager to purchase them,
         because that very sort of hair is made use of in his country to adorn the breast-plates of
         the warriors. We attempted to go directly into the grove, under which the habitations were
         situated; but the natives opposing it, we advanced along the point, picking various plants,
         and particularly a scurvy-grass, which was common, and seemed to be very wholesome. The
         natives shewed us that they bruised this plant, mixed it with shell-fish, and threw it into
         the sea, wherever they perceive a shoal of fishes. This food intoxicates them for some
         time, and thus they are caught on the surface, without any other trouble than that of
         taking them up. The name which they give to this useful plant is e-Now. We likewise met
         with plenty of purslane, resembling the common sort, which the natives call e-Tooree. This
         plant likewise grows at the Society Islands, and is there dressed under-ground, and eaten
         by the people. There were several sorts of trees on this island which grow in the Society
         Isles, and likewise some plants which we had not seen before. The soil was extremely
         scanty; the foundation consisted of coral, very little elevated above the surface of the
         water. On this we found a coarse white sand, mixed with fragments of coral and shells, and
         a very thin covering of mould. We advanced insensibly round the point, so as to come behind
         the habitations, and discovered another point jutting out into the lagoon, and forming a
         kind of bay, of which the shore was perfectly covered with shrubberies and groves. Between
         the two points the water was very shallow; and we perceived a great body of the natives
         crossing over from the farthest point, and dragging their spears after them. We immediately
         retired into the thicket, and passed by the huts, of which all the inhabitants were on the
         beach. These huts were very small and low, covered with a kind of matting of coco-nut
         branches. We only saw some dogs in them. Their boat-houses were exactly of the same
         materials, only a little larger. The canoes in them were very short, but stout, and pointed
         at both ends, and had sharp keel. As soon as we came on the beach, we mixed among the
         natives, who were rather surprised to see us come out of their village. We acquainted the
         lieutenant who commanded our boats with the hostile appearances we had seen, upon which our
         people were upon their guard, and prepared to reimbark. In the mean time Mahine assisted us
         in conversing with the natives, who told us that they had a chief or areekee, and that they
         called their island Teoukea. Their language, upon the whole, approached very much to the
         Taheitian dialect, except that their pronunciation was more coarse and guttural. The
         reinforcement now began to appear in the bushes, armed with long clubs, or round short
         staves, and spears, some fourteen feet, some nine feet long, pointed with the jagged tail
         of the sting-ray. We therefore stepped into our boats, but the natives crouded about them,
         and seemed in doubt whether they should detain us or not; however, as our retreat had been
         too early for their scheme, they appeared contented with our departure, and assisted us in
         pushing off the boats. Some threw small stones into the water near us, and all seemed to
         glory in having, as it were, frightened us off. They all talked a great deal, and very
         loud, after we were gone, and at last seated themselves along the beach, in the shade of
         the trees. We were no sooner on board, and had recited our adventures, than the captain
         ordered four or five cannon-shot to be fired over their heads, and into the sea before
         them, to shew what he could do. These balls, and especially the last, terrified them so
         much, that they all ran away from this point with the greatest precipitation. The number of
         coco-nuts which we obtained among them did not amount to more than thirty, and the dogs
         were about five. Mr. Byron found wells on this island, which, though they afforded but a
         small quantity of fresh water, may be sufficient to supply the few inhabitants with this
         necessary element. That navigator likewise met with burying-places of stone, in the grove,
         which have a very great affinity with the Taheitian maraïs. The offerings of animal and
         vegetable food, hung on the branches of trees around these cemeteries, strengthen that
         similarity. There is reason to believe, from this circumstance, as well as from the form,
         manners, and language of the people, that they are very nearly allied to the happier
         inhabitants of the mountainous isles in the neighbourhood. The great lagoons within their
         circular islands are probably plentiful reservoirs of fish, from whence they are supplied
         with constant food. The sandy barren part of their ledges is a fit place upon which turtles
         may deposit their eggs; and it appears from the fragments found by the Dolphin's people,
         that they know how to catch these large creatures, whose nutritive flesh and shell must be
         a delicious treat to them. The few plants which thrive about them are very useful, and
         furnish them with the means of facilitating the capture of fish; some trees are so large
         that their trunks may be used for canoes, and their branches for weapons and tools. The
         coco-palm, which is the principal support of many nations on the globe, is likewise of
         infinite service to them, and almost every part of it is useful. The nuts which it bears,
         whilst they are green, contain from a pint to a quart of limpid liquor, which has a very
         pleasant sweetness, joined to a peculiar agreeable flavour; its coolness and integrant
         particles, doubtless, make it a most delicious draught, powerful beyond comparison in
         quenching thirst in a hot climate. When the nut grows older, the kernel forms, which is at
         first like a rich cream, and afterwards grows firm and very oily, like an almond, being
         extremely nutritious. The oil is frequently expressed, and employed to anoint the hair and
         the whole body, at certain times. The hard shell provides the natives with cups; and the
         fibrous coating round it affords all kinds of cordage, which are strong, elastic, and not
         much impaired by constant use. Several articles of Indian houshold furniture, and several
         sorts of ornaments are made with it. The long feathered leaves or branches, which spread
         from the top of the stem, are fit coverings for their houses; and when plaited, make good
         baskets for provisions. The inner bark yields a kind of cloth, sufficient for covering the
         body in a hot climate; and the stem itself, when grown too old to bear, is at least fit to
         be used in the construction of a hut, or may make the mast of a canoe. But besides fish and
         vegetable food, they have also dogs, which live upon fish, and are reckoned excellent meat
         by the natives of the Society Islands, to whom they are known. Thus Providence, in its wise
         dispensations, made even these insignificant narrow ledges rich enough in the productions
         of nature, to supply a whole race of men with the necessaries of life. And here we cannot
         but express our admiration, that the minutest agents are subservient to the purposes of the
         Almighty Creator. The coral is known to be the fabrick of a little worm, which enlarges its
         house, in proportion as its own bulk encreases. This little creature, which has scarce
         sensation enough to distinguish it from a plant, builds up a rocky structure from the
         bottom of a sea too deep to be measured by human art, till it reaches the surface, and
         offers a firm basis for the residence of man! The number of these low islands is very
         great, and we are far from being acquainted with them all. In the whole extent of the
         Pacific Ocean, between the tropics, they are to be met with; however, they are remarkably
         frequent for the space of ten or fifteen degrees to the eastward of the Society Islands.
         Quiros, Schouten, Roggewein, Byron, Wallis, Carteret, Bougainville, and Cook have each met
         with new islands in their different courses; and what is most remarkable, they have found
         them inhabited at the distance of two hundred and forty leagues to the east of Taheitee.
         Nothing is more probable than that on every new track other islands of this kind will still
         be met with, and particularly between the 16th and 17th degree of S. latitude, no navigator
         having hitherto run down on that parallel towards the Society Islands. It remains a subject
         worthy the investigation of philosophers, to consider from what probable principles these
         islands are so extremely numerous, and form so great an archipelago to windward of the
         Society Islands, whilst they are only scattered at considerable distances beyond that group
         of mountainous islands? It is true, there is another archipelago of coral ledges far to the
         westward; I mean the Friendly Islands; but these are of a different nature, and appear to
         be of a much older date; they occupy more space, and have a greater quantity of soil, on
         which all the vegetable productions of the higher lands may be raised.</p>

      <p><date>[Monday 18.]</date>After leaving Teoukea we stood off and on during night, and then
         continued our course beyond the adjacent island, which is comprehended under Mr. Byron's
         appellation of King George's Islands. It resembled Teoukea perfectly, and only seemed to be
         larger. Its length from N. to S. appeared to be near eight leagues, and the breadth of its
         lagoon five or six miles. It had numerous clumps of bushes and trees, and was adorned with
         a great number of coco-nut palms.</p>

      <p><date>[Tuesday 19.]</date>The next morning, at eight o'clock, we decried another island of
         the same nature, but which we suppose had not been seen before. Towards noon another
         appeared to the westward, which we coasted all the afternoon. It was about eight leagues
         long, and full of people, who ran along the shore with very long spears in their hands. The
         lagoon within was very spacious, and several canoes sailed about upon it. It appears to me,
         that the most elevated and richest spots on the coral-ledges, are generally to leeward,
         sheltered from the violence of the surf. In this sea, however, there are seldom such
         violent storms, as might make these isles uncomfortable places of abode; and when the
         weather is fair, it must be very pleasant sailing on the smooth water in the lagoon, whilst
         the ocean without is disagreeably agitated. A third new island was seen in the evening,
         which we left the next morning, after we had lain to all night. This group captain Cook
         called Palliser's Islands; they are situated in about 15° 36' S. latitude, and 146° 30'
         W.longitude. The northernmost of these islands seem to be the Pernicious Islands on which
         Roggewein lost the African galley. As Mr. Byron found a boat's rudder on Teoukea, which is
         at a short distance from these isles, that circumstance serves to confirm my supposition
         .</p>

      <p>We now steered to the S. W. being clear of the low-islands, and continued standing on, the
         following night, towards the island of Taheite. The general satisfaction which this course
         gave to all on board can scarcely be described. Assured of the good disposition of the
         inhabitants, we could look upon this island as our second home. Our sick had some hopes of
         recovery, by having an opportunity of walking or resting in its cool shades, and by using
         the light salubrious diet of the islanders. The rest expected to acquire new strength and
         vigour, to enable them to encounter those perils and hardships which were yet in reserve
         for them. The captain was sure of meeting with that abundance of refreshments, which would
         enable him to bring the voyage to a happy conclusion; the astronomer longed to fix an
         observatory on shore, in order to determine the rate of going of the time-keeper, which had
         not been settled since our departure from New Zeeland; and we were not less desirous of
         returning to this island, in order to complete, in some measure, a botanical collection,
         which our short stay in the winter season had left but too imperfect.</p>

      <p>Our friend Mahine was perhaps more anxious than us all to see Taheitee, which he had never
         visited, though many of his relations and friends resided there. As the natives of the
         Society Islands allow it the first rank in affluence and power; and as we had frequently
         confirmed this testimony to him, his curiosity was so much the greater. But he had other
         motives which prompted him to wish himself there.</p>

      <p>He had collected a considerable number of curiosities, which he was well convinced would
         give him weight among his countrymen; and he had acquired such a variety of new ideas, and
         seen so many distant and unknown countries, that he was persuaded he would attract and
         demand their attention. The prospect of being courted by every body, and the idea of
         distinguishing himself by his intimacy with us, by his acquaintance with our manners, and
         above all, by making use of our fire arms for his diversion, gave him infinite pleasure. It
         is not to be doubted, that it was inhanced by the hope of being serviceable to all his
         shipmates, whom he loved with the sincerest affection, and by whom he was generally
         esteemed in return.</p>

      <p><date>[Thursday 21.]</date>We discovered land about ten o'clock the next morning, which in
         a few hours afterwards we knew to be part of Taheitee. We stood towards it all the day, but
         could not reach it before it became dark, and were therefore obliged to stay out another
         night. Every person on board gazed continually at this queen of tropical islands; and
         though I was extremely ill of my bilious disorder, I crawled on deck, and fixed my eyes
         with great eagerness upon it, as upon a place where I hoped my pains would ease. Early in
         the morning I awoke, and was as much surprised at the beauty of the prospect, as if I had
         never beheld it before. It was indeed infinitely more beautiful at present, than it had
         been eight months ago, owing to the difference of the season. The forests on the mountains
         were all clad in fresh foliage, and gloried in many variegated hues; and even the lower
         hills were not entirely destitute of pleasing sports, and covered with herbage. But the
         plains, above all, shone forth in the greatest luxuriance of colours, the brightest tints
         of verdure being profusely lavished upon their fertile groves; in short, the whole called
         to our mind the description of Calypso's enchanted island.</p>

      <p>With such a landscape before us, it cannot be doubted, but that our eyes were continually
         fixed upon it. We had the farther pleasure to distinguish every well-known spot as we
         sailed along. At last the beautiful scenery of Matavaï opened to our view in all its
         grandeur; and we directed our course into the bay, from whence we had sailed near eight
         months before.</p>

      <head>CHAP. VI.</head>

      <p><date>[1774. April.][Friday 22.]</date>WE were no sooner discovered from the shore, than
         several canoes put off to welcome us with presents of fruit. Among the first who came on
         board, were two young men of some note, whom we immediately invited into the cabin, where
         they were made acquainted with Mahine. The politeness of the nation required that they
         should make him a present of clothing; accordingly they took off their own upper garments,
         which were of the best sort, and put them on him. He gratified them in return with a sight
         of his rarities, and made them a present of a few red feathers, which they valued very
         highly.</p>

      <p>At eight o'clock in the morning we dropped an anchor in Matavaï bay, and were surrounded
         presently after by a whole fleet of canoes, in which our old friends brought us fish,
         bread-fruit, apples, coco-nuts, and bananas, all which they sold at low rates with the
         greatest readiness. Their fish were mullets and bonitos, which they brought perfectly alive
         in a kind of trough, fixed between the two hulls of a double canoe, and provided with
         wicker-work at both ends, where the water freely entered.</p>

      <p>Some tents were now established once more on Point Venus, for the purpose of making
         astronomical observations, as well as for the convenience of trading, wooding, and
         watering. The captain, Dr. Sparrman, and my father went on shore, whilst I remained on
         board so ill that I could scarcely crawl about. I amused myself, however, in trading out of
         the cabin windows, and by that means collected a number of curious fish, whilst they
         brought home nothing new from their excursion. They had found the appearance of the whole
         country much improved; the verdure luxuriant, many trees still loaded with fruit; the
         brooks full of water, and a great number of new houses built. Mahine, who went on shore
         with them, did not return at night, having found several of his relations, and particularly
         a sister, named Teïòä, one of the prettiest women on the whole island, who was married to a
         tall, well-made man, called Noona, of the better class of people, and native of Raietea.
         His house was very large, and near our tents, being only about a hundred yards beyond the
         river. Mahine had laid aside his European cloaths before he went on shore, and put on the
         elegant new dresses his friends had brought him, with a degree of pleasure and eagerness,
         in which a natural predilection for the manners of his country was very conspicuous. There
         are many instances among different nations in an imperfect state of civilization, and
         likewise among savages, that the force of habit produces this effect. It is no wonder that
         a native of the Society Isles should prefer the happy life, the wholesome diet, and the
         simple dress of his countrymen, to the constant agitation, the nauseous food, and the
         coarse aukward garments of a set of seafaring Europeans; when we have seen Eskimaux return
         with the utmost ardour to their own desolate country, to greasy seal-skins, and rancid
         train-oil, after having been entertained with substantial viands, the pomp of dress, and
         the magnificence of London. Mahine had indeed found the happiness and pleasure which he had
         expected. He was courted and looked upon as a prodigy by all the Taheitians who saw him; he
         was feasted with their choicest meats, he received several changes of dress, and revelled
         among the nymphs of the land. Sensible to pleasure, like all the children of nature, but
         debarred the sight of his pretty countrywomen for a long while, and perhaps tinctured with
         a double relish for sensuality by his acquaintance with sailors, the facility of gratifying
         every wish had endeared the country to him, and captivated him more than any thing else.
         Besides these incitements, the ship, in a warm climate, was but an uncomfortable abode at
         night. There he would have been pent up in a narrow, close, ill-scented cabin; whereas on
         the shore he breathed a pure air, deliciously perfumed by the exhalations of fragrant
         flowers, and was continually fanned by a cooling gentle land-wind, exactly like young
         Zephyr, who has such great obligation to the poets. Whatever the exalted degree of pleasure
         might be, which fell to the share of the happy Mahine, there were those on board who
         thought their situation worthy of envy. Immediately on the first evening several women came
         on board, and the excesses of the night were incredible. I have already observed before,
         that the women who made a practice of this intercourse were all of the common or lowest
         class, and I shall only add at present, that they were the same who had been so liberal of
         their favours during our first stay at this island. It is therefore obvious, that the
         prostitutes are only a particular set among the rest, and that the custom is far from being
         so general as hath been hitherto supposed, on the faith of other accounts. It would be
         singularly absurd, if o-Maï were to report to his countrymen, that chastity is not known in
         England, because he did not find the ladies cruel in the Strand.</p>

      <p><date>[Saturday 23.]</date>The next day we had delightful weather, and a great number of
         natives came on board. I ventured to go on shore to the tents in the forenoon, but after
         walking about thirty yards, I was obliged to turn back and sit down, in order to prevent my
         fainting away. The fine apples, which the natives brought for sale, looked so extremely
         tempting, that I ventured to transgress the positive order of the physician, and having
         regaled myself with one of them, returned on board immediately. Not less than fifty large
         bonitos had been purchased by our people during my short stay on shore, for spikenails and
         knives; and besides these we had obtained such a quantity of fruit, that we were enabled to
         serve it out in plentiful portions. At my return I found a native in irons, who had already
         taken an opportunity to pilfer some nails in the ship. Several of the better sort of people
         interceded very strongly, and presented a number of bonitos, in order to procure his
         release. These were accepted, and he was set at liberty, with a warning not to practise the
         same tricks again.</p>

      <p>The women who had passed the first night on board returned in the evening, and several
         others came with them; so that every sailor had his partner. The night was very fair and
         moon-light, and being dedicated to St. George, the tutelar saint of England, the pleasures
         of Venus were joined to the usual orgies of the festival.</p>

      <p>Dr. Sparrman and my father had been on shore the whole day, and returned after sunset. They
         had walked across One-tree-hill into the province of Parre. There they met with Tootahah's
         mother, and Happaï, the father of the king, to whom they made some small presents. They
         were likewise accosted by a native there, who did them several good offices, and
         particularly swam a considerable way in a pond where they had shot some wild-ducks. They
         continued marching to the westward at least ten miles from Point Venus to their new
         friend's dwelling. He prepared them a very good meal of fruit, and baked them a rich and
         most delicious kind of pudding, which is made of the kernel of coco-nuts and eddy-roots,
         scraped very small, and mixed together. The trees about his hut furnished him with
         abundance of fresh coco-nuts, of which he offered a great number to his guests. After
         dinner he presented them with a perfumed dress of the best sort, and attended them back
         again with a quantity of fruit, which remained untouched. He slept that night on board, and
         went away the next morning highly delighted with several knives, nails, and beads. As they
         returned they came near the king's house, and there saw the two goats which captain
         Furneaux had presented to him. The she-goat had brought two kids soon after our departure,
         which were almost full-grown. The whole breed was in excellent order, extremely sleek and
         well fed, and their hair as soft as silk. If the natives continue to take the same care of
         them, they will shortly be able to turn them wild on the mountains, where they would
         propagate prodigiously, and afford them a new and most valuable article of food.</p>

      <p><date>[Sunday 24.]</date>The next morning I found myself greatly relieved by the apple
         which I had eaten; and captain Cook, who still had some remains of his bilious complaint,
         had felt the same effect from the use of this excellent fruit. We continued therefore to
         eat it; and recommended it to all the bilious patients. Our recovery in consequence was
         much quicker than we had any reason to expect, and in a few days no other symptom than a
         slight weakness remained.</p>

      <p>A number of chiefs came on board this day with large hogs, and canoes loaded with fruit,
         all which were purchased for iron ware. Towards noon, the king, O-Too, with his sister
         Towraï, and his brother came on board, though it had rained just before. They brought a
         present of several hogs to captain Cook, and the king seemed to have entirely laid aside
         that distrust, which had so strongly characterised him before. They received some hatchets;
         but the principal thing for which they enquired were red parrot's feathers, which they
         called oora. The accounts of Mahine, and the little presents of this precious plumage which
         he had made to his friends, had given rise to this enquiry. We immediately searched all our
         collections from the Friendly Islands, and found a considerable quantity, which we did not
         think proper to show all at once. O-Too and his sister were gratified with a sight of a
         part of our riches, at which they seemed perfectly amazed and delighted. I have already
         mentioned, when I spoke of purchasing these feathers, that some were glued on a piece of
         cloth close to each other, and some were dispersed on stars of coco-nut core wrought in
         fret-work. Our royal guests received a small portion of the first sort, about the size of
         two fingers, beside a star or two, with which, for the present, they went away contented,
         as it seemed, beyond their warmest hopes. These red feathers, with which they ornament the
         dress of their warriors, and which perhaps are made use of on some other solemn occasions,
         are valued at an incredible rate in this island, and clearly prove the existence of a great
         degree of luxury among the natives.</p>

      <p><date>[Monday 25.]</date>On the next day we had a number of visits from different chiefs,
         amongst whom was our friend Potatowhis wife Whainee-ow, and his former wife Polatehera,
         whom the fame of our great riches of red feathers had reached. They brought with them
         numbers of hogs, many of which were exchanged with the utmost avidity for small pieces of
         cloth covered with red feathers. The difference between the present opulence of these
         islanders, and their situation eight months before, was very astonishing to us. It was with
         the utmost difficulty that we had been able to purchase a few hogs during our first stay,
         having been obliged to look upon it as a great favour, when the king or chief parted with
         one of these animals. At present our decks were so crouded with them, that we were obliged
         to make a hog-stye on shore. We concluded, therefore, that they were now entirely recovered
         from the blow which they had received in their late unfortunate war with the lesser
         peninsula, and of which they still felt the bad effects at our visit in August 1773. In the
         morning we had continual hard showers, and such violent thunder and lightning, that, for
         the sake of greater safety, a copper chain was fixed to the maintop-gallant-mast-head. Just
         as a sailor was clearing it of the shrouds, and had thrown the end over board, a terrible
         flash of lightning appeared exactly over the ship, and the flame was seen to run down along
         the whole length of the chain. A tremendous thunder-clap instantaneously followed, which
         shook the whole ship, to the no small surprize of both the Europeans and Taheitians on
         board. However we happily suffered not the least damage from this explosion. This
         circumstance confirms the great use of the electrical chain, which had been so clearly
         proved at Batavia, while captain Cook lay there in the Endeavour .</p>

      <p>The rain did not abate till the evening, when the showers became intermittent, and entirely
         ceased the next morning. <date>[Tuesday 26.]</date>The first intelligence which we received
         from our tents was, that several waistcoats and blankets belonging to the captain had been
         stolen by the natives, from the man who was washing them. The captain embarked therefore
         about ten o'clock, in order to visit O-Too, by whose help he hoped to recover his
         bed-cloaths. I was now so well recovered, that I ventured to accompany him in the boat,
         with my father, Dr. Sparrman, and some others. When we approached O-Parre, we beheld one of
         the most magnificent sights which it is possible to be entertained with in the South Sea.
         This was a very numerous sleet of great war-canoes, lying arranged along the shore,
         completely fitted out, and manned with rowers and warriors, dressed in their robes,
         targets, and towering helmets. The shores were lined with crouds of people, and a kind of
         solemn silence prevailed among them. We landed, and were met by Tee, one of the king's
         uncles, who was going to lead captain Cook into the country, when the commander in chief of
         the fleet stepped on shore and met them. At sight of him the common people exclaimed, "
         Towhah is coming," and made room for him with a degree of veneration which surprised us.
         The chief advanced to captain Cook, and taking him by the hand, called him his friend, and
         desired him to step into his canoe. It appeared to us at that time that Tee was uneasy, and
         did not approve of captain Cook's going with Towhah; therefore, when we were just abreast
         of his canoe, which was one of the largest, the captain stopped short, and refused to go on
         board. Towhah left him very coolly, and, to all appearance hurt at the refusal, stepped
         into one of the canoes. We then walked down along the whole range of vessels, whose prows
         were turned to the shore. All our former ideas of the power and affluence of this island
         were so greatly surpassed by this magnificent scene, that we were perfectly left in
         admiration. We counted no less than one hundred and fifty-nine great double war-canoes,
         from fifty to ninety feet long betwixt stem and stern. When we consider the imperfect tools
         which these people are possessed of, we can never sufficiently admire the patience and
         labour with which they have cut down huge trees, dubbed the plank, made them perfectly
         smooth, and at last brought these unweildy vessels to the great degree of perfection in
         which we saw them. A hatchet, or, properly, an adze of stone, a chissel, and a piece of
         coral, are their tools, to which they only add the rough skin of a ray, when they smooth or
         polish their timber. All these canoes are double, that is, two joined together, side by
         side, by fifteen or eighteen strong transverse timbers, which sometimes project a great way
         beyond both the hulls, being from twelve to four and twenty feet in length, and about three
         feet and a half asunder. When they are so long, they make a platform, fifty, sixty, or
         seventy feet in length. On the outside of each canoe there are, in that case, two or three
         longitudinal spars, and between the two connected canoes one spar is fixed to the
         transverse beams. The heads and sterns were raised several feet out of the water,
         particularly the latter, which stood up like long beaks, sometimes near twenty feet high,
         and were cut into various shapes. A white piece of cloth was commonly fixed between the two
         beaks of each double canoe, in lieu of an ensign, and the wind swelled it out like a sail.
         Some had likewise a striped cloth, with various red chequers, which, as we afterwards
         learned, were the marks of the divisions under the different commanders. At the head there
         was a tall pillar of carved-work, on the top of which stood the figure of a man, or rather
         of an urchin, whose face was commonly shaded by a board like a bonnet, and sometimes
         painted red with ochre. These pillars were generally covered with bunches of black
         feathers, and long streamers of feathers hung from them. The gunwale of the canoes was
         commonly two or three feet above the water, but not always formed in the same manner; for
         some had flat bottoms, and sides nearly perpendicular upon them, whilst others were
         bow-sided, with a sharp keel, like the section drawn in captain Cook's first voyage . A
         fighting stage was erected towards the head of the boat, and rested on pillars from four to
         six feet high, generally ornamented with carving. This stage extended beyond the whole
         breadth of the double canoe, and was from twenty to twenty-four feet long, and about eight
         or ten feet wide. The rowers sat in the canoe, or under the fighting stage on the platform,
         which consisted of the transverse beams and longitudinal spars; so that wherever these
         crossed, there was room for one man in the compartment. Those which had eighteen beams, and
         three longitudinal spars on each side, besides one longitudinal spar between the two
         canoes, had consequently no less than a hundred and forty-four rowers, besides eight men to
         steer them, four of whom were placed in each stern. This however was not the case with the
         greatest part of the canoes here assembled, which had no projecting platforms, and where
         the rowers or paddlers sat in the hulls of the canoe. The warriors were stationed on the
         sighting stage, to the number of fifteen or twenty. Their dress was the most singular, and
         at the same time the most thewy sight in the whole fleet. They had three large and ample
         pieces of cloth, with a hole in the middle, put on one above another. The undermost and
         largest was white, the next red, and the uppermost and shortest brown. Their targets or
         breast-plates were made of wicker-work, covered with feathers and shark's teeth, and hardly
         any of the warriors were without them. On the contrary, those who wore helmets, were few in
         number. These helmets were of an enormous size, being near five feet high. They consisted
         of a long cylindrical basket of wicker-work, of which the foremost half was hid by a
         semicylinder of a closer texture, which became broader towards the top, and there separated
         from the basket, so as to come forwards in a curve. This frontlet, of the length of four
         feet, was closely covered with the glossy bluish green feathers of a sort of pigeon, and
         with an elegant border of white plumes. A prodigious number of the long tail feathers of
         tropic birds diverged from its edges, in a radiant line, resembling that glory of light
         with which our painters commonly ornament the heads of angels and saints. A large turban of
         cloth was required for this huge unweildy machine to rest upon; but as it is intended
         merely to strike the beholder with admiration, and can be of no service, the warriors soon
         took it off, and placed it on the platform near them. The principal commanders were
         moreover distinguished by long round tails, made of green and yellow feathers, which hung
         down on the back, and put us in mind of the Turkish bashas. Towhah, their admiral, wore
         five of them, to the ends of which several strings of coco-nut core were added, with a few
         red feathers affixed to them. He had no helmet on, but wore a fine turban, which sat very
         gracefully upon his head. He was a man seemingly near sixty years of age, but extremely
         vigorous, tall, and of a very engaging noble countenance.</p>

      <p>Having reached our boat again, we rowed along under the sterns of the canoes to the end of
         the file. In each canoe we took notice of vast bundles of spears, and long clubs or
         battle-axes, placed upright against the platform; and every warrior had either a club or
         spear in his hand. Vast heaps of large stones were likewise piled up in every canoe, being
         their only missile weapons. Besides the vessels of war, which we found to consist of one
         hundred and fifty-nine double canoes, we counted seventy smaller canoes without the ranks,
         most of which were double likewise, with a roof on the stern, intended for the reception of
         the chiefs at night, and as victuallers to the fleet. A few of them were seen, on which
         banana-leaves were very conspicuous; and these the natives told us were to receive the
         killed, and they called them e-vaa no t'Eatua, " the canoes of the Divinity." The immense
         number of people thus assembled together was, in fact, more surprising than the splendor of
         the whole shew. Upon a very moderate calculation, there could not be less than fifteen
         hundred warriors, and four thousand paddlers, besides those who were in the provision
         boats, and the prodigious crouds on the shore.</p>

      <p>We were at a loss to know the meaning of this armament, nor could we obtain any information
         till we came back to our ship. The king having left O-Parre and gone into the district of
         Matavaï, we returned on board about noon. There we found many chiefs, and among the rest
         Potatow, who dined with us, and informed us, that the whole armament was intended against
         the island of Eimeo, of which the chief, a vassal of O-Too, had revolted. We learnt at the
         same time, to our greater surprize, that the fleet which we had seen was only the naval
         force of the single district of Atahooroo, and that all the other districts could furnish
         their quota of vessels in proportion to their size. This account opened our eyes, in regard
         to the population of the island, and convinced us in a few moments, that it was much more
         considerable than we had hitherto supposed. The result of a most moderate computation gave
         us one hundred and twenty thousand persons in the two peninsulas of Taheitee .</p>

      <p>The number of districts in both peninsulas amounts to forty-three; we assumed at a medium,
         that each could equip only twenty war-canoes, and we supposed each of these to be manned
         only with thirty-five men. The sum of men employed in the fleet, exclusive of the attending
         boats, would then be no less than thirty thousand; and these we assume as the fourth part
         of the whole nation. What makes this computation still more moderate is, that we suppose
         these thirty thousand to be the whole number of persons capable of bearing arms, or fit for
         service; and that the common proportion of these men, to the rest of the people, is much
         smaller than one fourth, in all the countries of Europe.</p>

      <p>Captain Cook returned to O-Parre with us in the afternoon. The whole fleet had already left
         that district, and the canoes were dispersed; but we found O-Too, and were extremely well
         received. He conducted us to several of his houses, through a country which perfectly
         resembled a garden; shady fruit-trees, shrubberies with odoriferous flowers, and rivulets
         enlarged into limpid sheets of water, continually varied before the eye. The houses were
         all kept in the best order; some were surrounded with walls of reeds, but others were open
         like the usual dwellings of the people. We passed several hours in his company, with some
         of his relations, and principal attendants, who took every method to express their
         friendship towards us. The conversation, though not yet very coherent, was however
         extremely lively; and the women in particular laughed and chatted with the greatest good
         humour. We often found them diverting each other by playing upon words; and sometimes we
         were highly entertained with a real witty stroke, or a humorous sally. It was near sunset
         when we departed, after sharing some part of the happiness which seems to be so natural to
         this favoured island. The calm contented state of the natives; their simple way of life;
         the beauty of the landscape; the excellence of the climate; the abundance, salubrity, and
         delicious taste of its fruits, were altogether enchanting, and filled the heart with
         rapture. Surely the satisfaction which we naturally feel in the happiness of others, is one
         of the most delightful sensations with which the human soul is blessed.</p>

      <p><date>[Wednesd. 27.]</date>The next morning the captain and my father paid another visit to
         O-Too at Parre, and found there the admiral of the fleet, Towhah, to whom they were
         introduced by O-Too himself. They all came on board before noon, and visited every part of
         the ship above and below decks, particularly to gratify the curiosity of Towhah who had
         never seen a ship before in his life. He paid more attention to the multitude of new
         objects on board, to the strength and size of the timbers, masts, and ropes, than any
         Taheitian we had ever seen, and found our tackle so exceedingly superior to that which is
         usual in his country, that he expressed a wish to possess several articles, especially
         cables and anchors. He was now dressed like the rest of the people in this happy island,
         and naked to the waist, being in the king's presence. His appearance was so much altered
         from what it had been the day before, that I had some difficulty to recollect him. He
         appeared now very lusty, and had a most portly paunch, which it was impossible to discern
         under the long spacious robes of war. His hair was of a fine silvery grey, and his
         countenance was the most engaging and truly good-natured which I ever beheld in these
         islands. The king and he staid and dined with us this day, eating with a very hearty
         appetite of all that was set before them. O-Too had entirely lost his uneasy, distrustful
         air; he seemed to be at home, and took a great pleasure in instructing Towhah in our
         manners. He taught him to make use of the knife and fork, to eat salt to his meat, and to
         drink wine. He himself did not refuse to drink a glass of this generous liquor, and joked
         with Towhah upon its red colour, telling him it was blood. The honest admiral having tasted
         our grog, which is a mixture of brandy and water, desired to taste of the brandy by itself,
         which he called e vaï no Bretannee, British water, and drank off a small glass full,
         without making a wry face. Both he and his Taheitian majesty were extremely chearful and
         happy, and appeared to like our way of living, and our cookery of their own excellent
         provisions. They told us that their fleet was intended to reduce the rebellious people of
         Eimeo (or York Island) and their chief, Te-aree-Tabonooee, to obedience, adding, that they
         would make the attack in a district of that island, called Morea. Captain Cook proposed, in
         jest, to accompany them with his ship, and to fire upon the enemies of O-Too, which at
         first they smiled at, and approved of; but presently after they talked among themselves,
         and then changing their tone, said they could not make use of his assistance, being
         resolved to go out against Eimeo the fifth day after our departure. Whatever might be the
         real motive of this resolution, it certainly was the most politic in their situation. We
         were too powerful an ally, not to be formidable even to those for whom we should fight; and
         waving that consideration, it was making the people of Eimeo too important, to bring our
         invincible four-pounders against them; for to these only would the victory be ascribed,
         even by the vanquished; and as soon as we should have left the island, the conquerors would
         lose much of that importance which they had in the eyes of their enemies before the battle.
         Such a degree of contempt might prove fatal to them in the end.</p>

      <p><date>[Thursday 28.]</date>My father, with Dr. Sparrman, a sailor and a marine, went on
         shore the next day in the afternoon, with an intent to go up to the summit of the
         mountains. We had a great number of canoes about us all this time, and in them there were
         always some chiefs of different districts, who brought on board their hogs, and their most
         valuable possessions, in order to exchange them for red feathers, on which they placed an
         extravagant value. These feathers produced a great revolution in the connections which the
         women had formed with our sailors; and happy was he who had laid in a sufficient stock of
         this useful and precious merchandize at the Friendly Islands; the women crouded about him,
         and he had the choice of the fairest. That our red feathers had infused a general and
         irresistible longing into the minds of all the people, will appear from the following
         circumstance. I have observed, in the former part of this narrative, that the women of the
         families of chiefs never admitted the visits of Europeans; and also that whatever liberties
         some unmarried girls might with impunity allow themselves, the married state had always
         been held sacred and unspotted at Taheitee. But such was the force of the temptation, that
         a chief actually offered his wife to captain Cook, and the lady, by her husband's order,
         attempted to captivate him, by an artful display of all her charms, seemingly in such a
         careless manner, as many a woman would be at a loss to imitate. I was sorry, for the sake
         of human nature, that this proposal came from a man, whose general character was in other
         respects very fair. It was Potatow who could descend to this meanness, from the high spirit
         of grandeur which he had formerly shewn. We expressed great indignation at his conduct, and
         rebuked him for his frailty. It was very fortunate for us, that a considerable quantity of
         this red plumage had been disposed of by our sailors at the Marquesas, in exchange for
         artificial curiosities, before they knew the high value which it bore at Taheitee. Had all
         these riches been brought to this island, the price of provisions would in all likelihood
         have been raised to such an unreasonable height, that we might have fared even worse than
         during our first visit. A single little feather was a valuable present, much superior to a
         bead or a nail, and a very small bit of cloth, closely covered with them, produced such
         extatic joy in him who received it, as we might suppose in an European, who should
         unexpectedly find the diamond of the Great Mogol. Potatow brought on board his monstrous
         helmet of war of five feet high, and sold it for red feathers; some others followed his
         example, and targets without number were bought by almost every sailor. But much more
         surprising than this, was their offering for sale those curious and singular mourning
         dresses, which are mentioned in captain Cook's first voyage , and which they would not part
         with on any account at that time. These dresses being made of the rarest productions of
         their island, and of the surrounding sea, and being wrought with the greatest care and
         ingenuity, must of course bear a very considerable value among them. A number of complete
         mourning dresses, not less than ten, were purchased by different persons on board, and
         brought to England. Captain Cook has given one to the British Museum, and my father has had
         the honour of presenting another to the University of Oxford, now deposited in the
         Ashmolean Museum. This remarkable dress consists of a thin flat board, of a semicircular
         form, about two feet long, and four or five inches broad. Upon these are fixed four or five
         chosen mother of pearl shells, by means of strings of coco-nut core passed through several
         holes which are pierced in the wood, and in the edges of the shells. A larger shell of the
         same kind, fringed with bluish-green pigeon's feathers, is fixed to each end of this board,
         of which the concave margin is placed upwards. Upon the middle of the concave margin there
         are two shells, which together form nearly a circle about six inches in diameter; and on
         the top of these a very large piece of mother of pearl, commonly with its purple coating
         on, is placed upright. It is of an oblong shape, enlarging rather towards the upper end,
         and its height is nine or ten inches. A great number of long white feathers, from the
         tropic bird's tail, form a radiant circle round it. From the convex margin of the board
         hangs down a tissue of small pieces of mother of pearl, in size and shape something like an
         apron. This consists of ten or fifteen rows of pieces about an inch and a half long, and
         one-tenth of an inch in breadth, each piece being perforated at both ends, in order to be
         fixed to the other rows. These rows are made perfectly streight and parallel to each other;
         therefore the uppermost are divided, and extremely short, on account of the semicircular
         shape of the board. The lower rows are likewise commonly narrower, and from the ends of
         each row a string hangs down, ornamented with opercula of shells, and sometimes with
         European beads. A tassel or round tail of green and yellow feathers hangs down from the
         upper ends of the board on the side of the apron, which is the most shewy part of the whole
         dress. A strong rope is fixed on each side of that pair of shells, which rests immediately
         upon the concave margin of the board, and this string is tied about the head of the person
         who wears the dress. The whole piece hangs down perpendicularly before him, the apron hides
         his breast and stomach, the board covers his neck and shoulders, and the first pair of
         shells comes before his face. In one of these shells there is a small hole cut out, through
         which the wearer must look in order to find his way. The uppermost shell, and the long
         feathers round it, extend at least two feet beyond the natural height of the man. The other
         parts of his dress are not less remarkable. He puts on a mat or a piece of cloth with a
         hole in the middle, like the usual dress of the country. Over this he places another of the
         same sort, but of which the fore part hangs down almost to the feet, and is beset with many
         rows of buttons made of pieces of coco-nut shell. A belt, consisting of a twisted rope of
         brown and white cloth, is tied over this dress round the waist; a large cloak of net-work,
         closely beset with great bluish feathers, covers the whole back; and a turban of brown and
         yellow cloth, bound with a great quantity of small twisted ropes of brown and white cloth,
         is placed on the head. An ample hood of alternate parallel stripes of brown, yellow, and
         white cloth descends from the turban to cover the neck and shoulders, in order that as
         little as possible of the human figure may appear. Commonly the nearest relation of the
         deceased wears this whimsical dress, and carries in one hand a pair of large pearl-shells,
         which are clapped or beaten together continually, and in the other a stick, armed with
         shark's teeth, with which he wounds any of the natives who chance to come near him . What
         may have been the origin of this singular custom we cannot determine; but to me it seems to
         be calculated to inspire horror; and the fantastical dress in which it is performed, has so
         much of that strange and terrifying shape which our nurses attribute to ghosts and goblins,
         that I am almost tempted to believe some ridiculous superstition lurks under this funeral
         rite. The spirit of the deceased, exacting a tribute of grief and tears from its survivors,
         and therefore wounding them with the shark's teeth, would not be an idea too extravagant
         for men to have adopted. Whatever it might be, we never could obtain any intelligence from
         the natives on the subject; they gave us an account of the ceremony, and of the dress,
         telling us the names of every part; but it was impossible to make ourselves understood, as
         soon as we wanted to know why it was so? The most singular fact with which Mahine acquaint
         us, relative to the mourning rite, was, that at the death of a man, a woman performs the
         ceremony; but when a woman dies, a man must go the rounds with the scare-crow dress. In
         England the curiosity has been so great, that a Taheitian mourning-dress, which a sailor
         brought over, has been sold for five and twenty guineas. But in this respect the Taheitians
         are no way inferior to civilized nations. In consequence of Mahine's relation to his
         adventures, the chiefs continually importuned us to give them curiosities from
         Tonga-Tabboo, &gt;Waïhoo, and Waitahoo , instead of English goods, in exchange for their
         provisions and curiosities. The feathered head-dresses of the two last islands, and the
         baskets, clubs, and painted cloth of the former, pleased them excessively; nay, they were
         eager to possess the mats of Tonga-Tabboo, though in general they perfectly resembled their
         own manufacture. Our sailors therefore frequently took advantage of their disposition, and
         gave them the same mats under another name, which they had formerly purchased in their own
         island, or in the Society Islands. Thus there is a similarity in the general inclinations
         of human nature, and particularly in the desires of all nations who are not in a state of
         savage barbarism, but have the advantage of civilization. The resemblance will appear still
         more perfect, if we relate with what eagerness the Taheitians listened to the accounts of
         their youthful traveller. They always attended him in crouds, their oldest men esteemed him
         highly, and the principal people of the island, not excepting the royal family, courted his
         company. Besides the pleasure of hearing him, they had likewise that of obtaining a number
         of valuable presents from him, which cost them only a few kind expressions. His time was so
         agreeably taken up on shore, as he found new friends in every hut, that he seldom came on
         board, unless to fetch a new set of presents, or to shew the ship to his acquaintance, and
         to introduce them to captain Cook and his shipmates. His stories, however, were too
         wonderful sometimes to find ready belief among his audience, who now and then applied to us
         for a confirmation of his account. The rain converted into stone, the solid white rocks and
         mountains which we melted into fresh water, and the perpetual day of the antarctic circle,
         were articles which even ourselves could not persuade them to credit. The account of
         canibals in New Zeeland was more easily believed, though it filled them with horror. He
         brought on board a company of the natives during my father's absence on the hills, who were
         come on purpose to see the head of the New Zeeland boy, which Mr. Pickersgill had preserved
         in spirits. He readily gratified them with the sight, and their report brought great
         numbers to see it. I was present when it was shewn, and it struck me to hear them give it a
         peculiar name in their language. They unanimously called it te Tae-aï, which appears to be
         equivalent to " man eater." The result of my enquiries among many of the chiefs and most
         intelligent people, on this extraordinary circumstance, was the following. They said they
         had a traditional report among them, that in an indefinite but very remote period of time,
         there were man-eaters upon their island, who made great havock among the inhabitants, and
         were a very strong robust people; but that this race had long since been entirely extinct.
         The same account was confirmed to me in the strongest terms, on my return to England, by
         o-Maï, with whom I happened to converse upon the subject. The influence of this fact upon
         the ancient history of Taheitee is very striking; but shall we conclude, that a set of
         canibals have by some accident made a descent upon the island, and committed depredations
         upon the indigenous people? or is it not rather evident, that the original state of the
         whole nation is concealed in this tradition, and that all the Taheitians were
         anthropophagi, before they arrived at that state of civilization, which the excellence of
         the country and climate, and the profusion of vegetables and animal food, has introduced?
         It is a fact no less surprising than certain, that the more we examine the history of
         almost every nation, the more we find this custom prevalent in the first periods of their
         existence. Traces of anthropophagy are still extant at Taheitee. Captain Cook saw fifteen
         recent jaw-bones hanging in one house . Might they not be preserved as trophies taken from
         their enemies?</p>

      <p><date>[Friday 29.]</date>The next morning one of the natives, who had attempted to steal a
         water-cask from our tents, was apprehended and confined. O-Too and Towhah coming on board
         somewhat early, being made acquainted with his offence, accompanied captain Cook on shore
         to see him punished. He was tied to a pole, and, with their consent, received two dozen of
         very severe lashes. A great croud of natives, who were spectators of this act, were so much
         terrified, that they began to run off; but Towhah called them back, and, in a speech which
         lasted about four or five minutes, pointed out the equity of our conduct, and the necessity
         of punishing thefts. He represented, that though our power was infinitely superior to
         theirs, yet we neither stole any thing, nor used any violence, but honestly paid a proper
         price for every thing we received, and frequently gave presents where we expected no
         return. That we had shown ourselves their best friends, and that to steal from friends was
         a shameful action, which highly deserved to be punished. The good sense and singleness of
         heart of this excellent old man, endeared him to us, and his harangue carried persuasion
         among his audience. In the afternoon Towhah came along side with his wife, and elderly
         woman, who seemed to have the same excellent character as her husband. They were in a large
         double canoe, with a roof built over the stern, and had eight rowers. The old couple
         invited Mr. Hodges and myself to come into the canoe, and we accompanied them to Parre.
         Towhah asked us a variety of questions during the time we were on the water, chiefly
         relating to the nature and constitution of the country from whence we came. As he had never
         seen any of our persons of high rank, he concluded that Mr. Banks could be no less than the
         king's brother, and that captain Cook was high admiral. The information which we gave him
         was received with the greatest marks of surprize and attention; but when we told him we had
         neither their coco-nut nor bread-fruit trees, he seemed to think but meanly of our country,
         though we enumerated all its other advantages. We were no sooner landed, than he ordered a
         repast of fish and fruit to be served up, and insisted on our partaking of it. We had just
         dined before we left the ship, but unwilling to give offence, we sat down and ate of the
         provisions, which were excellent. Indeed we could not but compare this happy country to
         Mahomed's Paradise, where the appetite is never cloyed by being gratified. The meal was
         already served, and we were going to help ourselves, when Towhah desired us to stop. In a
         few moments one of his attendants brought a large cook-knife, and some bamboo-sticks,
         instead of forks. Towhah carved the victuals, and gave each of us a bamboo, saying he would
         eat in the English manner. Instead of eating his bread-fruit by handfuls, he now cut it
         small, and took a bit of it after every morsel of fish, to shew how exactly he remembered
         our custom since the time of his dining with us. The good lady feasted apart some time
         afterwards, according to the invariable custom of the country. We walked about and chatted
         with them both till near sunset, when they embarked in their canoe, and returned to the
         district called Atahooroo, part of which belonged to Towhah. They took leave of us very
         cordially, and promised to return to the ship again in a few days. We hired a double canoe
         for a nail, and returned on board before it was dark. I found Dr. Sparrman and my father
         just returned from the mountains. Noona, the same lively and intelligent boy whom I have
         already mentioned in the former part of this narrative , had been their conductor. As they
         set out in the afternoon (on the 28th) they only reached a small hut on the second ridge,
         having crossed two deep vallies, and climbed two steep hills, rendered very slippery from a
         smart shower which had fallen. Here they found a man with his wife and three children. The
         man enlarged his cottage by means of branches of trees, and prepared them a supper; after
         which, having previously made a fire, they watched and slept by turns. The fire was seen on
         board our ship; and in return they heard the ringing of the ship's bell at midnight, though
         they were upwards of a league distant from it. The whole night was fair and cool; but their
         friendly host, whose name was Tahéa, had a violent cough. At day break they resumed their
         march towards the summits, and Tahea led the way, with a load of coco-nuts. The
         difficulties increased as they ascended; the paths running along the narrow ridge of steep
         hills, whose sides were almost perpendicular. The greatest danger arose from the
         slipperiness, occasioned by the rains of the preceding day. When they had ascended to a
         considerable height, they found thick shrubberies and woods on these steep sides; and
         attempting to collect plants there, they frequently met with precipices which are really
         tremendous. Still higher up the whole ridge was covered with a forest, where they gathered
         a number of plants, which they had never seen in the vallies below. After they had crossed
         the ridge, there fell a heavy shower of rain; and they coming to a very dangerous part,
         Tahea said they could go no farther. They resolved however to leave their heavy plant and
         provision bags behind, and went up with a single musket to the summit of the mountain,
         which they reached in about half an hour. Just about that time the clouds broke, and they
         had a prospect of Huahine, Tethuroa, and Tabbuamanoo. The view of the fertile plain under
         their feet, and of the valley of Matavaï, where the river makes innumerable meanders, was
         delightful in the highest degree. Thick clouds however prevented their discerning any thing
         on the south side of the island. In a few moments even the other part was covered again,
         and they were involved in a mist which wetted them to the skin. In their descent my father
         had the misfortune to fall in a very rocky place, and bruised his leg in such a manner,
         that he nearly fainted away. When he recovered, and attempted to proceed, he found that he
         had also received a dangerous rupture, for which he now continues to wear a bandage. Tahea
         assisted him in going down; and they all arrived on board about four o'clock in the
         afternoon. The upper hills they found to consist of a kind of clay extremely compact and
         stiff. The vegetation on the upper part of the mountains was luxuriant, and the woods
         consisted of many unknown sorts of plants. They enquired particularly for the perfume-wood,
         with which the natives perfume their oil. Tahea shewed them several plants which are
         sometimes used as substitutes; but the most precious sort itself he either could not, or
         would not, point out to them. O-Maï has told me that there are at Taheitee no less than
         fourteen different sorts of plants employed for perfuming; which shews how remarkably fond
         these people are of fine smells.</p>

      <p>The number of common women on board our ship was considerably encreased since we had begun
         to deal in red feathers; and this night in particular many strolled about the decks who
         could not meet with partners. The abundance of pork likewise attracted them; for being
         almost entirely deprived of that rich food in their own houshold, they were eager to obtain
         it among our sailors, and sometimes consumed incredible quantities. The goodness of their
         appetite and digestion exposed them however to the inconvenience of restlessness, and often
         disturbed those who wished to sleep after the fatigues of the day. On certain urgent
         occasions they always required the attendance of their lovers; but as they were frequently
         refused, the decks were made to resemble the paths in the islands. Every evening these
         women divided into different troops, which danced on the quarter-deck, the forecastle, and
         the main-deck. Their mirth was often extravagant and noisy; and sometimes their ideas were
         so original as to give great amusement. We had a very weak scorbutic patient when we
         arrived at Taheitee: this man being somewhat recovered by means of fresh vegetable food,
         and animated by the example of the crew, wooed a Taheitian girl; about dusk led her to his
         birth, and lighted a candle. She looked her lover in the face, and finding he had lost one
         eye, she took him by the hand, and conducted him upon deck again to a girl that was
         one-eyed likewise, giving him to understand, that that person was a fit partner for him,
         but that for her part she did not choose to put up with a blind lover.</p>

      <p><date>[1774. May.][Sunday 1.]</date>Two days after, my father, being in some measure
         recovered from the fatigue of his late excursion, and from the bruise which he had
         received, went on shore, and found there o-Rettee, the chief of o-Hiddea, a district and
         harbour where M. de Bougainville lay at anchor. This chief asked captain Cook, whether, on
         his return to England, he should see M. de Bougainville whom he called Potavirree; and
         being answered in the negative, he put the same question to my father. He replied, it was
         not impossible, though he lived in a different kingdom. " Then," said o-Rettee, " tell him
         I am his friend, and long to see him again at o-Taheitee; and in order that you may
         remember it, I will give you a hog as soon as I return from my district, to which I am now
         going." With that he began to relate, that his friend M. de Bougainville had had two ships,
         and that on board of one there was a woman, but that she was ugly. He rested a long while
         on this circumstance, and seemed to think it extraordinary that a single woman should go on
         such an expedition. He likewise confirmed the account of a visit from a Spanish ship, which
         we had learned during our first stay at Taheitee; but he assured us that he and his
         countrymen had no great affection for them. O-Rettee was a fine grey-headed man, but very
         healthy and vigorous, as the old people of Taheitee in general seem to be; his countenance
         was the picture of a lively, chearful, and generous man. He told us he had been in many
         battles, and shewed us several wounds he had received, particularly a blow with a stone on
         his temple, which had left a deep scar. He had fought by Tootahah's side, on the day when
         that chief was killed.</p>

      <p><date>[Monday 2.]</date>The next morning Dr. Sparrman went with me up the valley of
         Matavaï, which the natives call Tooa-ooroo. This was the first excursion of any length
         which I undertook after my illness: I was therefore highly delighted with the beautiful
         appearance of the vegetable creation, which had been revived by the late rainy season; and
         surprised at the vast improvements which I saw throughout the whole district. Wherever I
         went, I saw new and extensive plantations, in excellent order; I found numbers of new
         houses built, and the natives at work upon new canoes in many places. It was plain, during
         our former stay, that the war between the two peninsulas had been distressful to this part
         of the larger one; but at present there was not the least trace of it remaining; the whole
         country was a scene of plenty, where numbers of hogs grazed around every house, which none
         of the natives attempted to conceal from us, as they had formerly done. I was much pleased
         to observe an alteration in the behaviour of the natives, who never once importuned us with
         begging for beads or nails, and who, instead of being backward to part with their store,
         appeared eager to out-do each other in acts of benevolence and hospitality. We did not pass
         a single hut, where we were not invited to come in, and partake of some refreshment; and we
         never accepted their invitation, without being made extremely happy by their unaffected
         kindness. About ten o'clock we reached the mansion of that hospitable man, who had
         entertained us so well during our former stay on the island, when we came from the hills
         excessively fatigued . He treated us with a few coco-nuts, and we promised to come and dine
         with him on our return down the valley. He gave his directions accordingly, and accompanied
         us all the way. We found no habitations beyond his house, as the mountains on both sides
         approached very close together, and were excessively steep. Having advanced about a mile,
         we came to a place where the hill on the east side formed a perpendicular wall, not less
         than forty yards high, beyond which it had some inclination, and was crowned with
         shrubberies to a great height. A fine cascade fell from this fringed part along the wall
         into the river, and made the scene more lively, which in itself was dark, wild, and
         romantic. When we came nearer, we observed that the perpendicular rock had many projecting
         longitudinal angles, and on wading through the water to it, we found it to consist of real
         columns of black compact basaltes, such as the natives manufacture into tools. They stood
         upright, parallel, and joined to each other. Their diameter seemed not to exceed fifteen or
         eighteen inches, and only one or two angles of the same pillar projected or were visible.
         As it is now generally supposed that basaltes is a production of volcanoes, we have here
         another strong proof that Taheitee has undergone great changes by such subterraneous fires,
         where nature produced the most wonderful chymical operations, upon a very extensive plan.
         Beyond these columns the vale, for the space of two or three miles, is more and more
         confined by mountains, so that we found it difficult to proceed, having been obliged to
         cross the river near fifty times. At last we came to the same place where Mr. Banks was
         obliged to stop in his excursion . We found it equally impossible to proceed; and being
         much fatigued by continually clambering over rocks and rugged ground, set out on our
         return. By the way we collected some plants which we had not yet seen; and after a walk of
         two hours, reached the dwelling of our hospitable friend. We dined heartily on vegetables,
         and rewarded our host with red feathers to his heart's content; not forgetting to give him
         some iron-ware, which would prove useful to him when the feathers were lost or destroyed.
         His daughter, whom we had seen on our former visit, was now married to a man in a remote
         district, our presents having made her a rich heiress in this country. We came on board
         near sunset, having rambled very leisurely through the plain of Matavaï, captivated by the
         beauty and fertility of the prospect, and the additional lustre which a fine evening spread
         over it.</p>

      <p>Captain Cook, with my father and several officers, had been at Parre to visit O-Too. They
         had been conducted to a place where a new war-canoe was building, which the king intended
         to call O-Taheitee. But captain Cook made him a present of an English jack , a grapnel, and
         a grapnel-rope, and desired that it might be called the Britannia. The king immediately
         consented, the jack was hoisted, and the people gave three cheers.</p>

      <p>I recommended it to Mr. Hodges to visit the cascade which I had found in the valley; and
         accordingly the next day he went up with several gentlemen, and took a view of it, and of
         the basalt-pillars under it. We ate of a large albecore (scomber thynnus, Linn.) that day,
         which gave us all a sudden heat in the face, and a violent head-ache. Some had likewise a
         purging; and a servant who had entirely dined upon it, was violently affected with vomiting
         and purging. It is probable that the fish was caught by means of some intoxicating plant,
         which had perhaps communicated a noxious quality to the meat.</p>

      <p>We learnt about this time that Mahine had married the daughter of Toperree, a chief of
         Matavaï. A midshipman acquainted us that he had been present on the occasion, and that he
         had seen a number of ceremonies performed: but being intreated to give the particulars, he
         said, that though they were extremely curious, he could not remember one of them, and did
         not know how to relate them. By this means we lost the opportunity of making a considerable
         discovery, in regard to the customs of these islanders. It is pity that no intelligent
         observer was present, who might at least have related what he had seen. Mahine came on
         board with his bride, who was a very young girl, of a low stature, but not remarkable for
         beauty. She was very well skilled in the art of begging for presents, and went through the
         whole ship collecting a vast number of beads, nails, shirts, and red feathers, for which
         she was indebted to the friendship which every body felt for Mahine. This youth told us he
         had a great mind to settle at Taheitee, since his friends had offered him land, house, and
         property of all kinds there. He was received into an aree's family, esteemed by the king
         himself, and respected by all the people; nay, one of his friends had given him an
         attendant, or towtow, a boy who constantly waited on him wherever he went; who punctually
         executed all his orders, and seemed to be but little different from a slave.</p>

      <p>Though Mahine had laid aside the idea of going to England, yet the lively boy, Noona, was
         very desirous of visiting that country, and spoke to my father and several other gentlemen,
         in the most urgent terms, to take him on board. As my father proposed to take him entirely
         at his own expence, captain Cook consented immediately to his reception. The boy was
         however told, that he must never expect to come back, since it was very doubtful whether
         another ship would be sent to Taheitee again. Noona was too much bent upon going with us,
         to hesitate a moment even at this difficulty. He resigned the hope of returning to his
         country, for the pleasure of visiting ours. In the evening however of the same day captain
         Cook declared he would not take him on board, and he was accordingly obliged to remain at
         Taheitee. As it was intended to teach him the rudiments of the arts of the carpenter and
         smith, he would have returned to his country at least as valuable a member of society as
         O-Mai, who, after a stay of two years in England, will be able to amuse his countrymen with
         the music of a hand-organ, and with the exhibition of a puppet-show.</p>

      <p>We passed several days in visiting the plains of Matavaï, and the extensive valley of
         Ahonnoo, which is one of the most fertile, and, at the same time, most picturesque, in the
         whole island. <date>[Friday 6.]</date>On the 6th, in the afternoon, my father and Dr.
         Sparrman went up to the hills a second time, and I accompanied them, in hopes of meeting
         with some new plants there, since we had entirely exhausted the Flora of the plains. We
         passed the night again in Tahea's hut, with this difference, that we did not keep watch.
         Tahea was a merry humorous fellow; and it was his constant request to us to call him medua
         (father), and his wife o-pattèa (mother).</p>

      <p>We went up early the next day, but did not care to go quite to the summit. In the forest we
         collected a number of new plants, and shot a swallow. As we set out before sunrise, Tahea
         and his brother, who went up with us, caught some terns, which slept on the bushes along
         the path. He told us that many aquatic-birds come to rest on the mountains, after roaming
         all day over the sea in quest of food; and that the tropic-bird in particular has its nest
         there. The long tail feathers, which it annually sheds, are commonly found there, and much
         sought after by the natives. We saw the clouds coming over the summit, and descending
         towards us; therefore, in order to keep our plants dry, we hastened down, and at four
         o'clock reached the ship, where we found the whole royal family assembled, and among them
         Neehouraï, the eldest sister of O-Too, married to T'-aree-Derre, the son of Ammo .
         T'-aree-Watow, the king's next brother, staid after they were all gone, and passed the
         night on board. To amuse him we let off some false fires at the mast-head, with which he
         was highly entertained. At supper, he enumerated to us all his relations, and gave us some
         account of the history of Taheitee, which o-Maï entirely confirmed to me, after my return
         to England. From his information we learned, that Ammo, Happaï, and Tootahah were three
         brothers, and that Ammo, being the eldest, was king of all Taheitee. He married o-Poorèa
         (Oberea) a princess of the royal family, and had by her t'-Aree-Derre, who was immediately
         styled Aree-rahaï, or king of Taheitee. During the period of Ammo's reign, captain Wallis
         visited the island, and found o-Poorèa (Oberea) invested with regal authority. About a year
         after his departure, a war broke out between o-Ammo and his vassal Aheatua, the king of the
         lesser peninsula. Aheatua landed at Paparra, where Ammo commonly resided, and after routing
         his forces with great slaughter, destroyed the plantations and houses by fire, and carried
         off all the hogs and poultry which he could find. Ammo and Poorea, with all their
         attendants, among whom o-Maï, according to his own account, was one, fled to the mountains
         in December 1768. At last the conqueror consented to a peace, on condition that Ammo should
         entirely resign the government, and that the succession should be taken from his son, and
         conferred upon o-Too, the eldest son of his brother Happaï. This was agreed to, and
         Tootahah, the youngest brother of Ammo, was appointed regent. This revolution bears a great
         resemblance to those which happen too frequently in the despotic kingdoms of Asia. It is
         but seldom that the conqueror dares to govern the country which he has subdued; in general
         he only plunders it, and appoints another sovereign, whom he chooses from among the royal
         family of the land. O-Poorea soon after quarrelled with her husband, and frequently beat
         him; upon which they separated; he took a very handsome young women to his bed, and she
         heaped her favours on Obadee and other lovers. Some infidelity on the part of Ammo seems to
         have been the foundation of this quarrel. These accidents, which are not so frequent at
         Taheitee as in England, are however not absolutely unusual in that island, especially when
         the lady has lost the charms which rendered her amiable, and yet demands the same attention
         as before. An instance similar to this happened on board. Polatehera formerly the wife of
         Potatow, but now separated from him, had taken a young husband or lover in his stead, as
         soon as her first lord had provided himself with another partner. The young man had an
         affection for a Taheitian girl, and our ship was the place of their rendez-vous. They did
         not however contrive their amours so well, as to remain undiscovered. The masculine
         Polatehera caught them one morning, gave her rival many hearty boxes on the ear, and
         humbled the guilty lover with a severe reprimand.</p>

      <p>Captain Cook found the government of Taheitee in the hands of Tootahah, when he arrived in
         the Endeavour. After his departure Tootahah, being greatly enriched by the presents he had
         obtained, persuaded the chiefs of O-Taheitee-nue, or the Great Peninsula, to go against
         Aheatua, whom he could not forgive on account of the insult shewn to his family. They
         equipped a fleet, and went to Tiarraboo, where Aheatua was prepared to receive them. He was
         an old man , desirous to end his days in peace; and therefore sent to Tootahah, to assure
         him that he was his friend, and always intended to continue so; and that he desired him to
         return to his country, without attacking those who had an affection for him. Tootahah was
         not dissuaded from his purpose, but gave orders to engage. The loss on both sides was
         nearly equal, but Tootahah retired, in order to attack his enemy by land. Happaï, with all
         his family, disapproved of this step, and remained at o-Parre; but Tootahah took o-Too with
         him, and marched to the isthmus between the two peninsulas. Here Aheatua met him, and a
         pitched battle ensued, which ended in the total dispersion of Tootahah's army. Tootahah
         himself was killed. Some told us he had been taken prisoner, and was put to death
         afterwards; but others, and among them o-Maï, asserted that he had been slain in the heat
         of the engagement. O-Too retired precipitately to the mountains with a few chosen friends,
         whilst Aheatua, with his victorious forces, immediately marched to Matavaï and o-Parre. At
         his arrival Happaï retired to the mountains, but Aheatua sent to assure him that he had no
         quarrel with him or his family, and that his wish had always been for peace. Those on the
         mountain enquired in their turn concerning the fate of Tootahah and o-Too; they heard that
         the former was killed, and the no body knew what was become of the other. Soon after o-Too
         arrived through many difficult passes, and over precipices, and coming down from the
         highest summits, joined his father, and all who were with him. A general peace was
         immediately concluded, after which O-Too assumed the reins of government himself, and the
         vast improvements in the country, which we noticed in eight months time, seem to prove that
         he is a very intelligent man, who promotes the general good of his subjects. Aheatua died
         soon after; and his son of the same name, whom we found at Aitepeha in August 1773,
         succeeded him.</p>

      <p>Te-aree-Watow farther acquainted us, that his father had eight children. i. The eldest,
         Tedua (princess) Neehouraï, who seemed to be about thirty years old, and is married to the
         son of Ammo, called T'-aree-Derre. 2. The next Tedua (princess) Towraï, was unmarried,
         about seven and twenty, and appeared to have almost as great authority among the women, as
         the king her brother had in the whole island. 3. O-Too, aree-rahai, or king of Taheitee, is
         about twenty-six years of age; Aheatua is obliged to uncover his shoulders in his presence,
         as before his rightful paramount. 4. Tedua (princess) Tehamaï, who was the next to him,
         died young. 5. T'-aree-Watow himself was the next in order, and appeared to be about
         sixteen years of age; he told us he had another name, but which I have forgotten, from
         whence I conclude, that this which I have mentioned is only his title. 6. His next brother
         is Tubuaï-teraï, likewise called Mayorro, a boy of ten or eleven years old. 7. Erreretua, a
         little girl of seven years; and 8. Tepaow, a boy of four or five, are the two youngest. A
         healthy, but not corpulent habit of body, and a large bushy head of hair, were extremely
         characteristic of the whole family. Their features in general were pleasing, but their
         complexions rather brown, except that of Neehouraï and O-Too. The whole family appeared to
         be very much beloved among the nation, who in general are extremely fond of their chiefs.
         In return, their behaviour to every body was so affable and kind, that it commanded a
         general good-will. Tedua-Towraï commonly accompanied the king her brother when he came to
         visit us on board; and did not think she demeaned herself by going to trade for red
         feathers among the common sailors, in exchange for cloths and various curiosities. She
         happened once to be in the cabin with O-Too, captain Cook, and my father, looking over
         great heaps of iron ware, and other articles of trade; but the captain being called out,
         she whispered something to her brother, who immediately endeavoured to divert my father's
         attention by asking several questions. My father took the hint, and the princess believing
         she was not observed, concealed two large spike-nails in the folds of her garments. When
         captain Cook returned, my father acquainted him with this little stratagem; but they agreed
         that it was most politic not to take any notice of it. Before this time, she had frequently
         expressed a particular desire to carry away with her one or other article of our riches,
         and had never been refused; on the contrary, we had commonly given more than she demanded.
         It was therefore extraordinary, that she should be tempted to steal that which might so
         easily have been obtained by fair means; it should seem as if she had a strange
         predilection for things acquired by stealth, and for which she was only indebted to her own
         ingenuity. Some of the women on board likewise accused her of admitting towtows, or men of
         the lowest rank, to her bed at night privately, and unknown to her brother. In a country
         where the impulses of nature are followed without restraint, it would be extraordinary if
         an exception should be made, and still more so, if it should confine those who are
         accustomed to have their will in most other respects. The passions of mankind are similar
         every where; the same instincts are active in the slave and the prince; consequently the
         history of their effects must ever be the same in every country.</p>

      <p><date>[Sunday 8.]</date> O-Too came to the tents on Point Venus very early in the morning,
         and acquainted the serjeant of marines that one of the natives had stolen a musket from a
         centry, and was run off with it: he likewise dispatched Tee, his messenger, on board to
         fetch his brother, who obeyed the summons, after breakfasting with us. As soon as they
         returned on shore, O-Too, with all his family, fled to the westward, being apprehensive
         that the musket would be redemanded at their hands. Captain Cook seized several double
         travelling-canoes belonging to different chiefs, and particularly that of Maratata, who was
         accused of having ordered one of his attendants to commit the theft. This chief himself was
         in his canoe, and hastened to convey it out of our reach; but the captain firing several
         muskets at it, Maratata and all his rowers leaped into the sea, and swam ashore. About noon
         Tee came on board, and acquainted us that the thief was gone to the Lesser Peninsula, or
         Tiarraboo; upon which all the canoes, except Maratata's were again restored to their
         owners. We kept quiet on board till the afternoon, having but few of the natives with us,
         among whom there was not one woman. Towards evening captain Cook went ashore, and soon
         after some natives arrived in a most profuse perspiration, who brought no only the musket,
         but also a bundle of cloaths and a two-hour-glass, which had been stolen at the same time.
         They related, that having overtaken the thief, they had beaten him most severely, and
         obliged him to shew where he had concealed the stolen goods in the sand. Notwithstanding
         their appearance, we did not give much credit to their story, especially as one of them had
         been so lately seen about the tents, that it was impossible he could have run to any great
         distance. They received some presents, however, to shew that we meant to reward their zeal
         in our service. The next day there was no trade carried on; but Tee came on board again,
         desiring the captain to visit the king at Parré, who was matòw, an ambiguous court-phrase,
         expressing not only that he was afraid, but that he wished to be put into good humour with
         presents. The captain and my father went to him, whilst Dr. Sparrman and myself were put
         ashore at the tents. We found the people a good deal terrified at the extraordinary steps
         which had been taken, on our part, to do justice to ourselves. They had received strict
         orders from the king not to sell any provisions, however they treated us with coco-nuts and
         other refreshments with their usual hospitality. At noon we came on board, and the captain
         returned soon after, having ratified the friendship with O-Too. No women came on board this
         night, the king having prohibited it, lest they should give occasion to complaints, by
         stealing from our people. <date>[Tuesday 10.]</date>However the next day they were
         permitted to visit our sailors again; and with them came a number of canoes loaden with
         vegetable provisions, and some with fresh fish. Captain Cook sent Mahine with several
         presents to Towhah, into Atahooroo, in return for several hogs which he had received.
         During his absence, O-Poorea (Oberea) once the queen of Taheitee, came on board, and
         presented two hogs to captain Cook. The fame of our red feathers had reached to the plains
         of Paparra, for she told us she was come to have some of them. She appeared to be between
         forty and fifty; her person was tall, large, and fat, and her features, which seemed once
         to have been more agreeable, were now rather masculine. However something of her former
         greatness remained; she had " an eye to threaten or command ," and a free and noble
         deportment. She did not stay long on board, probably because she felt herself of less
         consequence in our eyes than formerly. After enquiring for her friends of the Endeavour,
         she went ashore in her canoe. O-Ammo likewise came to the ship about this time, but was
         still less noticed than his late consort; and being little known on board, was not
         permitted to come even into the captain's cabin. It was with difficulty that he could
         dispose of his hogs, as we had now so many on board, that we did not care to croud the
         decks with more. These two royal personages are living examples of the instability of human
         grandeur.</p>

      <p><date>[Thursday 12.]</date>We contrived several diversions for O-Too on the 12th. We fired
         our guns with round and grape-shot across the reef into the sea, at which he and a croud of
         several thousand spectators were highly delighted. In the evening we let off a few
         sky-rockets, and some air-balloons, which heightened their raptures, and filled them with
         admiration. They looked upon us as extraordinary people, who had fires and stars at
         command, and gave our fire-works the name of Heiva-Bretannee, the British Festival.</p>

      <p>All the next day a number of people surrounded the ship, who brought no provisions, but
         great quantities of cloth and curiosities, having observed that we prepared to leave them.
         In the afternoon we went to O-Parre with captain Cook, and found our worthy friend Towhah
         there with Mahine. Towhah had been dangerously ill of a disorder similar to the gout, and
         his legs were still swelled, and excessively painful. He was however come to take leave of
         us, and promised to visit us the next morning. O-Too likewise met us there, and spoke of
         sending a supply of bread-fruit, which we valued more than hogs at present. <date>[Saturday
            14.]</date>Early the next morning we received the visit of a great part of the nobility
         of the whole island. Among them was Happaï and all his children, except O-Too. Towhah and
         his wife likewise came about eight o'clock, and brought great loads of presents of all
         sorts to us. The good old admiral was so ill that he could not stand on his legs; he was
         very desirous however to come upon deck; we therefore flung a chair in ropes, and hoisted
         him up in it, to his great delight, and to the astonishment of all his countrymen. We
         discoursed on the subject of the intended expedition against Eimeo, which he still assured
         us would take place soon after our departure. Notwithstanding his illness, he was
         determined to command the fleet in person, saying it was of little consequence if they
         killed an old man, who could no longer be useful. He was very chearful under his
         infirmities, and his way of thinking was nobly disinterested, and seemed to be animated by
         true heroism. He took leave of us with a degree of cordiality and emotion, which touched
         the heart, and might have reconciled a misanthrope to the world. Mahine, who came on board
         with him, resolved to go with us to Raietea to visit his relations and friends in the
         Society Islands, and then to return to Taheitee, as soon as he should meet with an
         opportunity. He considered, that having possessions in several of those islands, it was his
         interest to return thither, and to dispose of them to the greatest advantage. He introduced
         to captain Cook several natives of Borabora, one of which was his brother; they desired a
         passage to the Society Islands, which captain Cook readily granted. With a degree of
         exultation, he imparted to us in confidence, that he had shared O-Poorea's bed the last
         night; this he esteemed as a great honour and mark of eminence, and shewed us several
         pieces of the best cloth, which she had presented to him. O-Poorea was therefore not too
         old to relish sensual gratifications even in a warm climate, where the epocha of maturity
         seems to happen at a much earlier age than in colder countries, and where of course every
         stage of human life might be supposed to have only a proportionate duration. O-Too not
         being arrived on board, we went to visit him once more, and to view some war-canoes which
         lay at Parre. We found only forty-four, all which belonged to Tittaha, the smallest
         district in the north-west peninsula of Taheitee. O-Too ordered some military evolutions to
         be made before us, which were performed with great dexterity. The chiefs were all dressed
         in their habits, and had targets, but no helmets. There were also some little boys, who
         wore the dresses, and parried the spears with as great agility as grown people. Their
         method was to rest the point of a spear or long battle-axe on the ground before them, so
         that it made an angle of about 25 or 30 deg. with the ground. With the other end, which
         they held in their hand, they contrived to keep the spear always in the middle, right
         before the body. By this means the spear of the adversary always slid off on one side or
         the other, without ever coming near the body. Some of the canoes likewise performed part of
         their manӕuvre. They came singly one after another through the narrow entrance of the reef;
         but as soon as they were within, they formed in a line, and joined close together. On the
         middlemost canoe there was a man placed behind the fighting stage, who gave signals with a
         green branch to the rowers, either to paddle to the right or left. The movement in
         consequence of his command was in perfect tune, and so very regular, that it seemed as if
         all the paddles were parts of the same machine which moved some hundred arms at once. This
         man might be compared to the Keleuzhz in the ships of the ancient Greeks: indeed, the view
         of the Taheitian fleet frequently brought to our mind an idea of the naval force which that
         nation employed in the first ages of its existence, and induced us to compare them
         together. The Greeks were doubtless better armed, having the use of metals; but it seemed
         plain, from the writings of Homer, in spight of poetical embellishment, that their mode of
         fighting was irregular, and their arms simple, like those of Taheitee. The united efforts
         of Greece against Troy, in remote antiquity, could not be much more considerable than the
         armament of O-Too against the isle of Eimeo; and the boasted mille carinœ, were probably
         not more formidable than a fleet of large canoes, which require from fifty to an hundred
         and twenty men to paddle them. The navigation of the Greeks in those days was not more
         extensive than that which is practised by the Taheitians at present, being confined to
         short passages from island to island; and as the stars at night directed the mariners
         through the Archipelago at that time, so they still continue to guide others in the Pacific
         ocean. The Greeks were brave; but the numerous wounds of the Taheitian chiefs, are all
         proofs of their spirit and prowess. It seems to be certain, that in their battles they
         rouze themselves into a kind of phrenzy, and that their bravery is a violent fit of
         passion. From Homer's battles it is evident, that the heroism which produced the wonders he
         records, was exactly of the same nature. Let us for a moment be allowed to carry this
         comparison still farther. The heroes of Homer are represented to us as men of supernatural
         size and force. The Taheitian chiefs, compared to the common people, are so much superior
         in stature and elegance of form, that they look like a different race . It requires a more
         than ordinary quantity of food to satisfy stomachs of unusual dimensions. Accordingly we
         find, that the mighty men at the siege of Troy, and the chiefs of Taheitee, are both famous
         for eating; and it appears that pork was a diet no less admired by the Greeks, than it is
         by the Taheitians at this day. Simplicity of manners is observable in both nations; and
         their domestic character alike is hospitable, affectionate, and humane. There is even a
         similarity in their political constitution. The chiefs of districts at Taheitee are
         powerful princes, who have not more respect for O-Too, than the Greek heroes had for the "
         King of men;" and the common people are so little noticed in the Iliad, that they appear to
         have had no greater consequence, than the towtows in the South Sea. In short, I believe the
         similitude might be traced in many other instances; but it was my intention only to hint at
         it, and not to abuse the patience of my readers. What I have here said is sufficient to
         prove, that men in a similar state of civilization resemble each other more than we are
         aware of, even in the most opposite extremes of the world. I should be sorry to have made
         these slight remarks, if they should unfortunately lead some learned schemer on a wrong
         scent. The itch of tracing the pedigree of nations has lately made such havock in history,
         by endeavouring to combine the Egyptians and Chinese, that the learned must sincerely wish,
         it may never become a contagious distemper.</p>

      <p>O-Too came on board, and dined with us for the last time. He proposed to my father and Mr.
         Hodges to stay at Taheitee, and promised very seriously to make them arees or chiefs of the
         rich districts of Parre and Matavaï. Whether he had any interested motives for this
         proposal, or whether it came merely from the fullness of his heart, I cannot determine. As
         soon as the dinner was over we weighed our anchor, and set sail. O-Too requested the
         captain to fire some cannon, and was the last Taheitian who stepped into his canoe, after
         cordially embracing us all. The noise of the cannon, by stunning our ears in some measure,
         diverted our thoughts from taking that melancholy turn which is natural on these occasions.
         It prevented our giving a loose to the soft feelings with which the worth of this simple
         and beneficent nation had inspired us; but it was a favourable opportunity for one of our
         seamen to make his escape to the island. He was observed swimming towards the shore, and
         some canoes were seen paddling to his assistance, when we dispatched a boat which brought
         him back, much against his inclinations. His frolic cost him a fortnight's confinement in
         irons. There is great reason to suppose that a plan was concerted between him and the
         natives, who perhaps had promised themselves as great advantages from retaining an
         European, as that European might expect by dwelling with them. If we fairly consider the
         different situations of a common sailor on board the Resolution, and of a Taheitian on his
         island, we cannot blame the former, if he attempted to rid himself of the numberless
         discomforts of a voyage round the world, and preferred an easy life, free from cares, in
         the happiest climate of the world, to the frequent vicissitudes which are entailed upon the
         mariner. The most favourable prospects of future success in England, which he might form in
         idea, could never be so flattering to his senses, as the lowly hope of living like the
         meanest Taheitian. It was highly probable, that immediately on his return to England,
         instead of indulging in repose those limbs which had been tossed from pole to pole, he
         would be placed in another ship, where the same fatigues, nocturnal watches, and
         unwholesome food, would still fall to his share; or though he were allowed to solace
         himself for a few days, after a long series of hardships, he must expect to be seized in
         the midst of his enjoyments, and to be dragged an unwilling champion to the defence of his
         country: to be cut off in the flower of his age, or to remain miserably crippled, with only
         half his limbs, might be the alternatives to which he would be reduced. But supposing he
         could escape these misfortunes, still he must earn his subsistence in England, at the
         expence of labour, and " in the sweat of his brow," when this eldest curse on mankind is
         scarcely felt at Taheitee. The drudgery of our country people is continual, and their
         exertion of strength very violent. Before they can make the least use of corn, they must
         undergo the various labours of ploughing, reaping, thrashing, and grinding. They are
         obliged to cultivate an hundred times more than they can consume, in order to support a
         breed of animals, whose assistance in husbandry is absolutely necessary; and to pay for the
         liberty of tilling the ground, for the articles of dress indispensable in a raw climate;
         for their tools, and a variety of things, which they might easily make with their own
         hands, if agriculture alone did not engross their time and attention. The tradesman, the
         manufacturer, the artist, all are obliged to work with equal assiduity, in order to furnish
         the goods, in return for which the farmer gives them bread. How different from this, how
         indolent is the life of the Taheitian! Two or three bread-fruit trees, which grow almost
         without any culture, and which flourish as long as he himself can expect to live, supply
         him with abundant food during three-fourths of the year. The superfluity is fermented and
         preserved, as a wholesome, nourishing and palatable bread, for the remaining months. Those
         plants which require the greatest attendance at Taheitee, the cloth-trees and eddo-roots,
         are cultivated with much less trouble than our cabbages and kitchen-herbs, though their
         uses are infinitely more extensive. The whole process necessary to plant a bread-tree, is
         to break off a sound branch, and stick it in the ground. The banana, whose rich clusters
         seem too great a weight for the herbaceous stem, annually shoots afresh from the root. The
         royal palm, at once the ornament of the plain, and a useful gift of nature to its
         inhabitants; the golden apple, whose salutary effects we have so strongly experienced, and
         a number of other plants, all thrive with such luxuriance, and require so little trouble,
         that I may venture to call them spontaneous. The manufacture of dress is an agreeable
         pastime for the women, and the building of houses and canoes, with the making of tools and
         arms, are occupations which become amusing by being voluntary, and intended for the more
         immediate use of the artificers. Most of their days are therefore spent in a round of
         various enjoyments, in a country where nature has lavished many a pleasing landscape; where
         the temperature of the air is warm, but continually refreshed by a wholesome breeze from
         the sea; and where the sky is almost constantly serene. This climate, and its salubrious
         productions, contribute to the strength and the elegance of their form. They are all
         well-proportioned, and some would have been selected by Phidias or Praxiteles, as models of
         masculine beauty. Their features are sweet, and unruffled by violent passions. Their large
         eyes, their arched eyebrows, and high forehead, give a noble air to their heads, which are
         adorned by strong beards, and a comely growth of hair . These, as well as their beautiful
         teeth, are the proofs of vigour, and of a sound habit of body. The sex, the partners of
         their felicity, are likewise well-formed; their irregular charms win the heart of their
         countrymen, and their unaffected smiles, and a wish to please, insure them mutual esteem
         and love. A kind of happy uniformity runs through the whole life of the Taheitians. They
         rise with the sun, and hasten to rivers and fountains, to perform an ablution equally
         reviving and cleanly. They pass the morning at work, or walk about till the heat of the day
         increases, when they retreat to their dwellings, or repose under some tufted tree. There
         they amuse themselves with smoothing their hair, and anoint it with fragrant oils; or they
         blow the flute, and sing to it, or listen to the songs of the birds. At the hour of noon,
         or a little later, they go to dinner. After their meals they resume their domestic
         amusements, during which the flame of mutual affection spreads in every heart, and unites
         the rising generation with new and tender ties. The lively jest, without any ill-nature,
         the artless tale, the jocund dance and frugal supper, bring on the evening; and another
         visit to the river concludes the actions of the day. Thus contented with their simple way
         of life, and placed in a delightful country, they are free from cares, and happy in their
         ignorance.</p>

      <p>It must be allowed, that these advantages are decisive with those, who have nothing so much
         at heart as the gratification of their senses. No wonder then that a sailor, perhaps less
         guided by reason than the rest of his comrades, should hurry on headlong after the
         pleasures of the present moment. It is certain, at the same time, that being born and bred
         up in an active sphere of life, acquainted with numberless subjects, utterly unknown to the
         Taheitians, and accustomed to extend his thoughts to past and future occurrences, he would
         shortly have been tired of an uninterrupted tranquility and continual sameness, suited only
         to a people whose notions are simple and confined.</p>

      <p>The ideas of happiness are infinitely various in different nations, according to their
         manners, principles, and degrees of civilization. As the productions and apparent good
         qualities of our globe, are either profusely or sparingly distributed, on its different
         parts, the diversity of human opinions is a convincing proof of that paternal love, and
         unerring wisdom, which, in the plan of this world, has provided for the good of mankind,
         alike in the torrid and the frigid zone.</p>

      <head>CHAP. VII.</head>

      <p><date>[1774. May.][Saturday 14.]</date>A Brisk gale carried us swiftly from Taheitee. We
         were still busied in contemplating its beautiful scenery, when an unexpected object on our
         own decks attracted our attention. This was no other than one of the finest women whom we
         had seen in the country, and who had resolved to go with us to Raietea (Ulietea), her
         native island. Her parents, from whom she had eloped to Taheitee with a favoured lover some
         years ago, were still alive, and the force of affection urged her irresistibly to visit
         them. She was by no means apprehensive of their anger, but on the contrary expected a kind
         reception. The little youthful errors of the heart are easily forgiven, where interest and
         ambition have so little sway. She had concealed herself on board during O-Too's last visit,
         as he had expressly ordered that no woman should go with us; but being safe at present, she
         ventured to make her appearance. Mahine's brother, his servant, and two other natives of
         Borabora, likewise took a passage with us, confidently relying on a people who had so
         faithfully brought one of their countrymen back again, and who had endeavoured to shew him
         every kindness in their power. Their company gave life to our conversation, and shortened
         the day of our passage to Huahine. The girl was dressed in a suit of cloaths belonging to
         one of the officers, and was so much pleased with her new garments, that she went ashore in
         them as soon as she arrived at that island. She dined with the officers, without the least
         scruple, and laughed at the prejudices of her country-men with all the good sense of a
         citizen of the world.1 With a proper education she might have shone as a woman of genius
         even in Europe; since, without the advantage of a cultivated understanding, her great
         vivacity joined to very polite manners, already were sufficient to make her company
         supportable.</p>

      <p><date>[Sunday 15.]</date>We sailed on all night; and the next morning, at day break, the
         island of Huahine was in sight. In the afternoon we came to an anchor in the northern
         branch of Wharre harbour, where we lay not more than fifty yards from the shore. We were
         visited by some of the natives, who brought hogs to sell, but demanded hatchets in return,
         which were now so scarce on board, that we reserved them for great occasions. Oree, the
         regent of the island, came to us before sunset in a small canoe, and brought a hog and a
         target of war to captain Cook,2 for which he received a suitable present. He gave us some
         pepper-roots this time, but without any of the ceremonies observed at our former visit to
         the island . In the evening we had a perfect calm, and were highly delighted with viewing
         and hearing the natives, who sat in their houses along the shore, around their candles,
         which are oily nuts stuck on a slender stick. One of the first who came on board the next
         day was Porea, the Taheitian youth, who had left that island with us eight months ago, but
         had withdrawn himself from us at Raietea. He told us, it was by no means with his consent
         that he staid behind. Having an amour with a pretty girl, she had appointed a rendezvous,
         to which he had hastened, after delivering the powder-horn to captain Cook. On his arriving
         at the place appointed with his fair mistress, he had been attacked by her father, with
         some attendants, who had stripped him of his European cloaths, beaten him soundly, and
         confined him till after our departure. He had then taken the first opportunity of crossing
         over to Huahine, where he had been supported by the hospitality of several friends, so that
         he was now in a very good plight. From his story we may gather, that the people of these
         islands do not always permit their daughters to follow their own inclinations; though
         according to our ideas, Porea's attempt did not authorise the father to rob him of his
         cloaths.</p>

      <p>We went on shore early, and rambled to the lagoons, which the sea forms to the northward of
         the harbour. We found them surrounded by swamps, filled with a variety of East Indian
         plants; and their shores consisted of a slimy mud, which, from its appearance, and fetid
         smell, we thought to be of the same nature and qualities with hepar sulphuris. There were
         great flocks of ducks upon the lagoon; but we found it difficult to approach them, as we
         sunk into the mud, whenever we ventured to walk through it. The prospect which this piece
         of water forms, is however extremely pleasing and picturesque. The stinking effluvia of the
         lagoons are probably esteemed unwholesome, as we observed but very few houses on their
         banks. On the sea side they are inclosed by a narrow coral ledge covered with sand, a
         little elevated, along which we found great number of coco-nut palms. The marshes slope
         down from this immediately to the stagnant water. We were entertained by one of the natives
         with coco-nuts, which were at present very scarce upon the island. In returning home our
         servant,3 who carried a bag with plants, and another with iron tools, was knocked down a
         few yards behind us, and would have been robbed, if we had not turned back by chance; but
         at sight of us the thieves ran off. This was the second time that our people were thus
         boldly attacked by the natives of Huahine, who seem, upon the whole, to be more licentious
         under the infirm government of old Oree, than those of Taheitee, and of the other Society
         Islands.</p>

      <p>This old chief appeared to be much more indolent at this time than at our first visit, and
         his intellects seemed to be considerably impaired. His eyes were red and inflamed, and his
         whole body lean and scaly. We were not long at a loss to account for this change, having
         observed that he was now much addicted to the intoxicating pepper-draught, of which he
         drank great quantities, prepared excessively strong. Mahine had the honour of drinking with
         him for several nights together, and received such a share of his nauseous beverage, that
         he commonly awoke the next morning with a violent head-ache.</p>

      <p>We made another excursion to the same place the next day, and brought back a number of
         corals, shells, and echini, which the natives had gathered for us on the sea-shore. We
         received presents of hogs and targets from different chiefs, who came on purpose to visit
         their old acquaintances, and would not sell or part with their goods, till they saw their
         friend for whom they were destined. The next day we took a walk up one of the hills, which
         is every where planted with bread-trees, pepper and mulberry-trees, yams and eddoes. The
         mulberry or cloth-trees were cultivated with particular attention; the ground between them
         was carefully weeded, and manured with broken decayed shells and coral, and the whole
         plantation surrounded with a deep furrow or channel, in order to drain it. In many places
         they had burnt away ferns and various shrubs, in order to prepare the ground for future
         plantations. At a considerable height upon the hill we found a house, the inhabitants of
         which, an old woman and her daughter, hospitably entertained us. We gave them several beads
         and nails, and some red feathers, which last were rather accepted as a curiosity, than as
         things of great value. This opinion was general among the people of Huahine; they wanted
         hatchets in exchange for their hogs, and smaller iron tools for other provisions, and as we
         were well stocked with animals, we did not like their price, though it was the same which
         we had formerly given. Since red feathers have really no intrinsic value, and are only used
         for ornament, we have another convincing proof of the superior affluence and luxury of the
         Taheitians, in the great eagerness which they expressed to purchase them.5 The difference
         is obviously owing to the excellence of their country, compared to Huahine, where the
         ambient plain is so narrow and inconsiderable, that the natives are obliged to cultivate
         the hills.</p>

      <p>Several bold thefts were committed, during the following days, by the natives, for which it
         was not in our power to obtain redress. Some other attempts however were punished. A party
         of petty officers were gone to take the diversion of shooting on a hill, and had a marine
         with them, who carried some hatchets and nails in a bag. A native who attended them, seeing
         that their fowling-pieces missed fire several times, took his opportunity, when the marine
         had laid down his bundle, to snatch it up, and ran off with it. The day after the gentlemen
         went to see a heiva or public dance, and luckily found the thief among the spectators. He
         confessed his misdemeanour, but promised, if they would pardon him, to bring them some
         targets in return, which were always reckoned equivalent to our hatchets. They were
         contented with his submission, and the man punctually kept his word the next day; which
         shews that he was by no means to be compared to our hardened sinners, but was fully
         sensible of the generous treatment which he had met with. Another attempted to steal a
         powder-horn, but he was detected, and requited by blows. Even the poor girl, who came on
         board at Taheitee, tempted them by wearing an European dress. A number of natives set upon
         her in a house, when she was least aware of it, and began to strip off her cloaths; when
         some of our people fortunately came by, who put the thieves to flight. This accident
         frightened her so much, that she never ventured out of the ship alone for the future.</p>

      <p><date>[Thursday 19.]</date>On the 19th we took a walk towards the long inlet, where Dr.
         Sparrman had been robbed about eight months before. The weather was rainy at first, and the
         showers became so severe, that we retreated into a small hut, to prevent our being wetted
         to the skin. We found here a friendly family, who immediately offered us some fresh
         bread-fruit and some fishes to eat, that being always the first mark of hospitality among
         the inhabitants of the South Sea. An elderly woman, of some note, had likewise taken
         shelter under the same roof, with one of her attendants, who led a hog to her home. As we
         set out together, when the shower was over, the good woman presented the hog to us, and
         invited us to her house, which lay at a considerable distance. We crossed the hill, and
         descended to the sea shore on the opposite side of the island. Our way was extremely
         slippery; but we collected a number of plants which had novelty to recommend them. The
         weather changed before we reached the plain below, and became delightfully fair. We found a
         bay, with an extensive shoal of coral, and a small islet, where great flocks of wild-ducks,
         curlews, and snipes resided. We received several refreshments from the natives, which our
         friendly old lady endeavoured to procure. After we had amused ourselves for some time with
         shooting, we crossed the hills in another direction, and passing through a fine valley,
         well inhabited, and rich in all sorts of plantations, we came to the woman's dwelling on
         the sea shore. Here we found an old man, her husband, and a large family, some of whom were
         grown up. She treated us with stewed fowls, bread-fruit, and coco-nuts, and then sent us in
         her own canoe to the ship, which lay about five miles off by sea, but at least twice as far
         by land. There was a kind of assiduity to serve us in this good woman's behaviour, which I
         had not often experienced in those numerous instances of hospitality, daily obvious to the
         stranger in the South Sea islands. It is a most convincing proof of the excellence of the
         human heart, in its simple state, before ambition, luxury, and various other passions have
         corrupted it.</p>

      <p><date>[Friday 20.]</date>We staid on board the next day till the afternoon, and then went
         ashore with captain Cook to a long house, which was a common receptacle, or carvansera,6
         for many families, who travelled thither in order to be near us. We found several inferior
         chiefs there; but Oree was gone to a different part of the island. After conversing with
         them for some time, several natives arrived, who brought an account that our first and
         second lieutenant, with one of the mates, had been stripped by several robbers. A great
         number of the inhabitants immediately fled, and all who remained expressed strong marks of
         fear. We could not collect with certainty, from the information of different people,
         whether our officers had been beaten or killed; the Taheitian word, matte, expressing both
         these ideas. We were however soon relieved from this state of suspense, by the appearance
         of the gentlemen, perfectly safe, with their arms and cloaths. They informed us, that
         having been shooting near the lagoons, they had been attacked unawares by some of the
         natives, who, upon their refusing to part with their fowling-pieces, had beaten them, and
         wrested those arms out of their hands; that a chief happening to pass by during the
         struggle, had come to their assistance, and had effected the recovery of every article
         which had been taken from them. We returned on board together, and observed that the
         natives forsook the adjacent country. The next morning early, Mahine, who had slept on
         shore, brought a message from Oree to captain Cook, importing that there were thirteen
         offenders, whom he could not punish without the captain's assistance: he requested him
         therefore to send twenty-two armed men, which he expressed by the same number of small
         sticks, and promised to join them with some of his own warriors, who should go out to
         chastise the rebels. Captain Cook went on shore with Mahine, in order to be more fully
         assured of Oree's intention; but not understanding enough of the language, he received very
         little intelligence. As soon as he returned on board, he consulted with the officers; and,
         on this occasion, the second lieutenant ingenuously confessed that they themselves had been
         the aggressors, and had drawn upon them the severe revenge which the natives had taken. One
         of them having shot a couple of ducks in the lagoon, desired a native, who attended him, to
         fetch them out of the water. The man, who had repeatedly done him this good office before,
         refused to serve as a spaniel any longer. Our officer beat him, however, till he went in,
         and worked himself through the mud with great agility, in a motion between swimming and
         walking. When he had reached the ducks, which lay at a considerable distance from the
         shore, he swam off with them to the opposite side of the lagoon, perhaps conscious that he
         deserved them for the trouble he had taken. As this did not agree with the seaman's
         intentions, he loaded his musket with ball, and fired, but fortunately missed him. He was
         preparing to load again, when the croud about him, seeing the life of their countryman so
         wantonly sported with, seized his arms. He called to his companions for help, but they were
         likewise surrounded; and though one of them fired a load of shot into the thighs of a
         native, this only exasperated them the more; so that he was beaten and bruised without
         mercy. Mahine's attendant, or servant, a stout youth, of a very low stature, accompanied
         our gentlemen, and fought desperately in their favour, but was overpowered by numbers.
         After this consession, the case was greatly altered; however, the captain resolved to
         question Oree once more, and to that purpose desired my father to accompany him to the
         shore, being convinced that no person on board was at this time so well versed in the
         language of the country.7 They soon learnt from Oree, that he intended we should march to
         the dwellings of the natives who had thus done themselves justice, and who seemed to have
         withdrawn themselves even from his power; and that he wished to take all their goods and
         hogs, and give them to us. Captain Cook returned to the ship, and selected a party of
         forty-seven Europeans, including the officers, Dr. Sparrman, my father, and myself; not
         indeed to reduce the rebellious subjects of Oree to their duty, who had so much reason to
         complain of injustice from our people, but perhaps to shew that he did not entirely approve
         of their conduct. We landed, and marched with Oree and a few of the natives towards the
         district where the robbery was committed. In proportion as we advanced, the croud at our
         heels encreased in number to several hundreds, and took up arms in the neighbouring houses.
         Oree himself wielded a spear ten feet long, with a barbed tail of sting-ray at the point.
         We halted at the distance of about two miles, and were now acquainted by Mahine that the
         natives had formed the plan of surrounding and cutting us off. Oree was desirous to stay
         behind; but captain Cook persuaded him and a few other chiefs to go with us, whilst the
         rest of the croud were ordered to proceed no further, under pretence, that in case of an
         engagement, we should not be able to distinguish friends from foes. We marched about three
         miles to a place where the path divided; we chose that which led across a very steep rock,
         in preference to another at the foot of it. Steps were cut in the rock on the opposite
         side, where we descended again on the plain. This pass was so dangerous, that captain Cook
         proposed to leave a detachment of his petty army here; but seeing that the croud advanced
         slowly after him, in spite of Oree's orders, he resolved to return, and declared to the
         natives that the enemy was too far off to be pursued. We came back to a spacious house,
         about halfway to the ship, where Oree regaled us with coco-nuts. Whilst we remained there,
         some of the natives brought several banana-stalks, two dogs, and a pig. They presented them
         to the captain, holding a long speech on the occasion, which was mostly unintelligible, but
         seemed to relate to the affair that had brought us into the field. A large hog was shewn to
         us at the same time, but instead of being presented, it was led off again. From hence we
         reached the sea-shore opposite the ship about noon, and then fired our muskets in platoons
         over the sea. This manӕuvre surprised the natives prodigiously, as it convinced them that
         we could keep up a constant fire, of which they had no idea before, and shewed them to what
         vast distances our balls could be projected. Thus ended our warlike expedition, to the wish
         of a few individuals amongst us, who had too great an affection for all their brethren, to
         desire their destruction. It was not so satisfactory to others, who, inured to the horrid
         scenes of war and bloodshed, had acquired, by force of habit, a detestable eagerness to try
         their skill in shooting at men, rather than at a mark!</p>

      <p>We saw but few natives about the ship all the next afternoon; some fruit was however
         exchanged for small nails. Our friends visited us the next morning, with many presents of
         different sorts. One of them, a chief, named Morurua, had singled out my father as his
         friend, and came with his wife and family to see us. Several articles were distributed to
         them, in return for those which the chief had brought; but he thought our present so much
         more valuable than his, that he seemed quite enchanted, and his eyes with peculiar
         eloquence expressed a lively sense of gratitude. <date>[Monday 23.]</date>He returned
         therefore to us again the next morning, when we were getting under sail, and after loading
         us with new presents, dissolved in tears at parting.</p>

      <p>We left the three friends of Mahine on this island, but had taken on board another native,
         who was sent from Oree with a message to O-Poonee, the king of Borabora. This ambassador
         appeared to be a very stupid fellow; we could not however dive into the secret of his
         mission, nor were any of us solicitous about it. His name was Hurree-hurree, which, in its
         English acceptation, seemed to be remarkably well chosen for a messenger.</p>

      <p><date>[Tuesday 24]</date>The next day before noon we anchored in the entrance of Hamaneno
         harbour, on the island of Raietea, and spent the rest of the day, till after sun-set, in
         warping the ship into the bason. The chief O-Rea came on board, and seemed highly delighted
         with our return. The appearance of Mahine and Hurree doubtless strengthened his good
         opinion of us, and inspired all his people with confidence. We went on shore to his house
         with captain Cook the next morning, <date>[Wednesd. 25.]</date>and were met by his wife and
         his daughter Poyadua. The wife cut her head with a shark's tooth, and received the blood on
         a bit of cloth; and both wept and sobbed aloud together for some time.8 However when they
         had concluded this ceremony, they were as merry as if nothing had happened. We were
         confined to his house by heavy showers of rain till noon, when we returned to the ship,
         which was now brought into a narrow creek, where she lay close to the shore, for the
         convenience of watering.</p>

      <p>We walked along this creek in the afternoon, as far as the intermittent showers would
         permit. The shore was lined with innumerable canoes, whilst every house and shed was
         crouded with people, many of whom were preparing large and luxurious dinners, from heaps of
         provisions which were every where accumulated. We were told that a peculiar society or
         order of persons of both sexes, named Arreoy,9 existed in these islands; and that they
         assembled at times from all parts, and travelled through all the islands, feasting and
         carousing to excess. During the time we lay at Huahine, we had observed no less than
         seventy canoes, with more than seven hundred of these arreoys on board, crossing over to
         Raietea in one morning. We were told that they had spent a few days on the east side of the
         island, and were arrived on its western shore only a day or two before us. We took notice
         that they were all persons of some consequence, and of the race of chiefs. Some of the men
         were punctured in large broad blotches; and Mahine assured us, these were the most eminent
         members of the society, and that the more they were covered with punctures, the higher was
         their rank. They were in general stout and well made, and all professed themselves
         warriors. Mahine had a very high veneration for this society, and told us he himself was a
         member. They are united by the ties of reciprocal friendship, and exercise hospitality
         towards each other in its greatest latitude. As soon as an arreoy visits another, though he
         were unknown to him, he is sure to have his wants supplied, and his desires gratified; he
         is introduced to other members of the order, and they vie with each other in loading him
         with caresses and presents. It was to this principle that Mahine ascribed all the pleasures
         which he had enjoyed at Taheitee. The first people who saw him on board were arreoys
         according to his account, and in that quality made him a present of their garments, since
         he had no other than European cloaths. It appears, that one or more persons of each little
         family of chiefs enter into this community, of which the invariable and fundamental
         character is, that none of its members are permitted to have any children. From the
         accounts of the most intelligent among the natives, we have great room to suppose, that the
         original institution required their living in perpetual celibacy. As this law was too
         repugnant to the impulses of nature, which must be uncommonly strong in their climate, they
         soon transgressed it; but preserved the intention of the prescribed abstinence, by
         suffocating their unfortunate offspring immediately after birth.</p>

      <p>The arreoys enjoy several privileges, and are greatly respected throughout the Society
         Islands and Taheitee; nay, they claim a great share of honour from the very circumstance of
         being childless. Tupaya when he heard that the king of England had a numerous offspring,
         declared he thought himself much greater, because he belonged to the arreoys . In most
         other countries the name of a parent gives honour and respect; but when an arreoy, at
         Taheitee, emphatically bestows it, it is meant as a term of contempt and reproach. The
         arreoys keep great meetings at stated times, travelling from one island to another. They
         feast on the choicest vegetables, and on plenty of pork, dog's flesh, fish, and poultry,
         which is liberally furnished by the towtows, or lower class, for their entertainment. The
         pepper-root drink is prepared and swallowed in surprising quantities on these occasions.
         Wherever they go, the train of sensual pleasure waits upon them. They are amused with music
         and dances, which are said to be particularly lascivious at night, when no other spectators
         besides themselves are admitted.</p>

      <p>In a country so far emerged from barbarism as Taheitee, it cannot be supposed that a
         society would have maintained itself to the present time, which appears so injurious to the
         rest of the nation, unless its advantages were so considerable, as to require its
         continuance. Two reasons seem to favour the existence of arreoys, and both are in some
         measure connected together. The first appears to be the necessity of entertaining a body of
         warriors, to defend their fellow-citizens from the invasions and depredations of enemies.
         This is confirmed by the circumstance, that all the arreoys are warriors; but as love might
         be supposed to enervate them, they were restrained to that celibacy, which they have since
         found it too difficult to observe. The second reason for the association of the arreoys,
         seems to be to prevent the too rapid propagation of the race of chiefs.10 An intelligent
         man, who perhaps was once the law-giver of Taheitee, might foresee, that the common people
         would at length groan under the yoke of this numerous and ever-multiplying breed of
         petty-tyrants . To oblige a part of them to a single life, was the shortest means of
         obtaining this end; but certain glaring advantages were to be held out, to make them submit
         without reluctance to such a restraint. From hence we may derive that high esteem with
         which the whole nation honours the order of arreoy; and likewise account for their
         authority, and for their gluttony in eating, which has been the privilege of warriors in
         every country, before they became the tools of tyranny. When the arreoys had once so far
         departed from the laws of their first institution, as to admit the commerce with the sex,
         it is easy to conceive, that, by insensible degrees, they have almost wholly lost the
         original chaste and sober spirit of the order. They are at present, without doubt, the most
         luxurious set of people in the island; though I have not found the least reason to charge
         them with a refinement in voluptuousness,11 which is at once improbable, and inconsistent
         with the tenderness of the whole people. We have been told a wanton tale of promiscuous
         embraces, where every woman is common to every man: but when we enquired for a confirmation
         of this story from the natives, we were soon convinced that it must, like many others, be
         considered as the groundless invention of a traveller's gay fancy.</p>

      <p>Some arreoys are married to a woman, in the same manner as Mahine was to the daughter of
         Toperree ; but others keep a temporary mistress. Many may perhaps revel in the arms of
         several prostitutes, which are to be met with in all the islands. This dissolute pleasure
         is however much more frequent in every civilized country of Europe; but I apprehend it
         would not authorise an assertion, that in Europe there exists a society of men and women,
         who practise a particular refinement of sensuality . When we consider the whole character
         of the Taheitians; when we recollect their gentleness, their generosity, their affectionate
         friendship, their tenderness, their pity, we cannot reconcile these qualities to the murder
         of their own offspring. We shudder at the stern inhumanity of the father, but much more so
         at the obdurate heart of the mother, where the voice of nature, and of powerful instinct,
         should cry aloud for mercy and protection. The paths of virtue are but too easily forsaken;
         still we are at a loss to conceive, how a people so much left to nature, could arrive at
         such a detestable pitch of depravity: but custom.</p>

      <p>gradually blunts every feeling, and overcomes the stings of remorse. We had no sooner
         learnt that such an unnatural and barbarous practice stigmatized the society of arreoy,
         than we reprehended our young friend Mahine for valuing himself on being a member of such a
         detestable body. We endeavoured to point out the immorality and cruelty of this practice,
         and made use of every argument which our reflections could furnish, or our words express.
         We easily succeeded in convincing him, and obtained a promise that he would not kill his
         children, but separate from the society as soon as he should receive the glorious name of
         father. To our great satisfaction he assured us, that the instances of arreoys having
         children were extremely rare. It seems that they choose their wives and mistresses among
         the prostitutes; and from this circumstance, as well as from their great voluptuousness,
         they have seldom reason to dread the intrusion of an unfortunate infant. The answers of
         O-Maï, whom I consulted on this subject after my return to England, gave me still greater
         pleasure, as they softened the transgression at least of one part, and entirely freed the
         bulk of the nation from that share of guilt, which the simple acquiescence in such a
         heinous crime might throw upon them. He assured me, that the invariable laws of the
         community of arreoy required the extinction of their offspring; that the pre-eminence and
         advantages which a man enjoyed as arreoy were so valuable, as to urge him on against his
         own feelings; that the mother was never willing to consent to the horrid murder, but that
         her husband and other arreoys persuaded her to yield up the child; and that when entreaties
         were not sufficient, force was sometimes employed. But above all, he added, that this act
         was always performed in secret, and so that none of the people, not even the towtows or
         attendants of the house, were present; because, if it were seen, the murderers must be put
         to death. This being the case, we may comfort ourselves with the reflection, that criminal
         individuals are not more numerous in the Society Islands, than among other people; and that
         the votaries of vice have no reason to triumph, in supposing a whole nation accustomed to
         commit unnatural murders, without a sense of wrong .</p>

      <p><date>[Thursday 26.]</date>The arreoys were no less hospitable than luxurious, and it was
         not for want of invitation that we did not partake of their refreshments. We rambled in the
         country till sunset, and then returned to the ship, which Mahine, the woman, and the other
         Indian passengers had now left. The next morning a great number of natives came to the ship
         in their canoes, among whom were many women, who remained with the sailors. At Huahine the
         commerce of this kind had been very inconsiderable, and chiefly confined to women who were
         only on a visit to that island; it was therefore resumed here with the greatest eagerness
         by our crew. We passed the day on an excursion to the northward, where we shot several wild
         ducks, and met with a hospitable reception in different cottages.</p>

      <p>The next was a fine day, delightfully tempered by a strong easterly gale. We received the
         visits of Orea and all his family, of Boba, the viceroy of the island of O-Tahà, and of
         Teïna, the fair dancing-woman, whose picture Mr. Hodges had formerly attempted to draw .
         Boba was a tall, handsome young man, a native of Borabora, related to Poonee, the king of
         that island, and conqueror of Raietea and Tahà. Mahine has frequently told us, that he is
         destined to be the successor of O-Poone, whose only daughter Maïwherua, said to be a young
         beautiful princess, twelve years old, he is to marry. Boba was at present an arreoy, and
         kept the lively Teïna as his mistress, who was with child in consequence. We entered into
         conversation with her on the custom of killing the offspring of an arreoy. The short
         dialogue which passed between us was couched in the most simple expressions, because we had
         not sufficient knowledge of the language to discourse of abstract ideas. For the same
         reason all our rhetoric was exhausted in a few moments, and had no other effect, than to
         draw the following concession from Teïna-maï: " that our eatua (deity) in England might
         perhaps be offended by the practice of the arreoys; but that her's was not displeased with
         it. She promised, however, if we would come from England to fetch her child, she might
         perhaps keep it alive, provided we gave her a hatchet, a shirt, and some red feathers."
         This was said in such a laughing tone, that we had not the least room to believe her in
         earnest. It was in vain to attempt to continue the conversation, since a variety of objects
         diverted her attention: it was a wonder indeed that she had lent an ear to our questions so
         long.</p>

      <p>In the afternoon we went ashore, to see a dramatic dance performed by Orea's daughter
         Poyadua, and found a great number of inhabitants assembled at the play-house; this
         diversion being admired by all ranks of the people. Poyadua displayed her agility as usual,
         and received great applause from the European spectators. The interludes performed by the
         men were something different from those we had seen before. We could plainly understand the
         name of captain Cook, and of several of our shipmates, mentioned in their songs, and they
         seemed to represent a theft committed by their people.13 Another of the interludes was the
         invasion of the Borabora men, which they expressed by beating one another with a thong or
         whip, which made a very loud smack. But still another was more curious than all the rest:
         it represented a woman in labour, and provoked immoderate pearls of laughter from the
         multitude. The man who acted this part went through the gestures, which the Greeks were
         wont to admire in the groves of Venus-Ariadne, near Amathus, where the same ceremony was
         acted on the second day of the month Gorpiœus, in memory of Ariadne, who died in child-bed
         . Thus it appears, that there is scarcely a practice, though ever so ridiculous, existing
         in any corner of the world, that has not been hit upon by the extravagant fancy of men in
         some other region. A tall stout fellow, dressed in cloth, personated the new born infant in
         such a ludicrous style, that we could not refuse joining in the plaudits which his
         countrymen bestowed upon him. Anatomists and midwives would have been surprised to observe,
         that this overgrown babe had every necessary character of a child newly born; but the
         natives were particularly delighted with his running about the stage, whilst the rest of
         the dancers endeavoured to catch him. The ladies were much pleased with this scene, which,
         according to the simplicity of their ideas, had not the least indecency; they looked on,
         therefore, unconcernedly, and were not obliged, like some European dames, to peep through
         their fans.</p>

      <p><date>[Saturday 28.]</date>The next morning we travelled along the shore to the southward,
         and met with a very fertile country, and hospitable people. We came early to a large
         building of stone, which was called Maraï no Parua, Parua's burying-place. I have already
         mentioned that this name was likewise given to Tupaya, who went in the Endeavour; but I am
         doubtful whether the burying-place relates to Tupaya, since it generally bears the
         appellation of some living chief. Indeed it is not improbable that another Parua might be
         alive on the island, after whom the maraï was named, especially as all the natives in the
         neighbourhood strenuously asserted, that this Parua was an aree, which was not always
         allowed of Tupaya. This monument was sixty yards long, and five wide; the walls were made
         of large stones, and about six or eight feet high. We climbed over, and found the space
         within covered with a heap of small coral stones.</p>

      <p>From thence we walked on several miles, till we arrived at a spacious bay, where three
         little islands lie within the reef. The country round this bay was swampy, and well stocked
         with ducks. Here we passed some time in shooting, and then embarked in two small canoes,
         and were safely landed at one of the little islands. We found a few coco palms and shrubs,
         but no fruit-trees upon it; and there was only a single fisherman's hut, containing some
         nets, and other fishing-tackle. We returned very soon to the main shore, having found no
         shells, though the hope of meeting with some had principally induced us to cross the water.
         We dined with a native who had invited us, and returned to the ship in a canoe about
         sun-set. The chief Orea had dined on board with captain Cook during our absence, and had
         drank about a bottle of wine, without appearing in the least intoxicated. He had however,
         as usual, been extremely facetious, and had conversed chiefly of the countries which we had
         lately visited, and of which he had received an account from his countryman Mahine. After
         being satisfied in regard to many particulars, he said, that though we had seen a great
         deal, he would tell us of an island which we had not met with in our voyages. " It lies,"
         said he, " but a few days sail from hence, but it is inhabited by a monstrous race of
         giants, as tall as the main-mast, and as thick about the middle as the drum-head of the
         capstan. They are very good-natured people, but if they are ever incensed against any body,
         they take him up, and throw him as far into the sea as I would throw a stone. If you should
         happen to come there with your ship, they would perhaps wade up to it, and carry it ashore
         on their backs." He added several other ludicrous circumstances, and concluded with telling
         us the name of the island, Mirro mirro, in order to give greater weight to his assertion.
         It appeared evidently to us, that his whole story was a fine piece of irony, directed
         against those parts of our narrative which he did not believe, and of which he could have
         no conception.14 We admired the witty humour which was so conspicuous in this little flight
         of fancy, and with M. de Bougainville looked up to its great source, the affluence of the
         country, which produced contentment and pleasure .</p>

      <p><date>[Sunday 29.]</date>During the next night some of the natives stole the rudders,
         grapnels, and boat-hooks belonging to our boats, which were fastened to the buoy. As soon
         as this theft was discovered in the morning, the captain acquainted Orea with it, who
         immediately embarked with him in a boat, and rowed several miles to the southward. In about
         an hour's time they landed, and almost all the stolen articles being returned to our
         people, they came back to the ship entirely satisfied. I had been on shore in the creek
         during this time, and saw a heeva, or dance, performed by two little girls; but their dress
         was not so grand, and their action much inferior to that of Poyadua. The tamow, or
         head-dress of plaited hair, was not laid like a turban, but formed several large locks,
         which had a pretty effect, and resembled in some measure the high heads of our modern
         ladies.</p>

      <p>In the afternoon Poyadua performed a dance; and as if she meant to outshine the other
         actresses, she had ornamented her dress more than usual, and wore a great quantity of
         various sorts of European beads. Her wonderful agility, the graceful motion of her arms,
         and the quick vibration of her fingers, were as much admired there by the natives, as we
         applaud them in our dancers; and since all these accomplishments are taught in the South
         Sea islands by nature only, it must be confessed that Poyadua deserved the encomiums which
         all the spectators bestowed upon her. The inhabitants were particularly delighted with the
         extraordinary contortions into which she screwed her mouth; though we were so little of
         their mind, that we could not help thinking them horridly frightful. The meeting of the
         arreoys gave rise to these frequent dramatic entertainments; their presence seemed to
         enliven the whole country, and to inspire all the people with extraordinary cheerfulness.
         They frequently shifted their garments,17 made of their best kinds of cloth; they passed
         their time in luxurious idleness, perfuming their hair with fragrant oils, singing and
         playing on the flute, and passing from one entertainment to another; in short, they enjoyed
         the blessings of their islands in the utmost extent; and so much resembled the happy
         indolent people whom Ulysses found in Phӕacia, that they could apply the poet's lines to
         themselves with peculiar propriety:</p>

      <p>Our friend Mahine was perhaps the only person among the nobility who did not enjoy that
         great degree of happiness which so visibly reigned among the rest. He was not received with
         those distinguishing marks of favour which had been lavished upon him at Taheitee; for it
         seems, even in the South Seas, a man is no where less esteemed than in his own country. All
         his relations, who were extremely numerous, expected presents as their due; whilst at
         Taheitee his liberality made him friends, and procured him great advantages. As long as the
         generous youth had some of those riches left, which he had collected at the peril of his
         life, on our dangerous and dismal cruize, he was perpetually importuned to share them out;
         and though he freely distributed all he had, some of his acquaintances complained that he
         was niggardly. He was soon reduced to beg a supply of European wares from his friends on
         board, having only saved a few red feathers, and some other curiosities, as a present for
         O-Poonee, the king of Borabora, to whom he was related. Under these disagreeable
         circumstances, he longed to return to Taheitee, and told us he was resolved to settle
         there, as soon as he should have visited Poonee and his other relations at Borabora. He
         would willingly have embarked with us again for England, if we had given him the least hope
         of returning to the South Sea; but captain Cook having told him, that no ship would ever be
         sent to his islands again, he deprived himself of the pleasure of seeing our country,
         rather than part for ever from his native groves. When we reflect on the fate of his
         countryman, O-Maï, we have some reason to think this determination fortunate for his heart
         and morals. The splendour of England remains unknown to him; but at the same time he has no
         idea of those enormities which disgrace the opulent capitals of the world.</p>

      <p>After the dance was over, Mahine invited us to the district in which his lands were
         situated. He had frequently told us, that he had possessions in this island; but as some of
         our people had doubted of his veracity, he was glad to take an opportunity of justifying
         himself. <date>[Monday 30.]</date>The next morning therefore, at day break, we set off in
         two boats, and taking on board Orea and all his family, we arrived, after two hours sail,
         at Wharai-te-Vah, a district at the north-east end of the island. We were welcomed by
         Mahine and two of his elder brothers, and conducted to a spacious house. A fire was
         immediately made in a hole in the ground, and some large stones heated. With the same
         preparations, which are already described by captain Cook in his former voyage , a large
         hog was killed, cleaned, wrapped in fresh leaves, and put into the hole or oven, and
         covered with hot stones and a heap of earth. Whilst it continued to be stewed there, with a
         quantity of fruit, my father, with Dr. Sparrman and myself, went up the neighbouring hills,
         where we found nothing new, though we were at least seven or eight miles from our ship.
         After a walk of two hours we returned, and in a short time our dinner was served up on
         green leaves. The fat of the entrails, together with the blood, had been wrapped up
         separately in a few leaves, and the fattest chiefs and arreoys in company immediately
         seized upon, and swallowed them by handfuls. The rest dined with an uncommon degree of
         voracity; whilst a great croud of towtows, with their greedy looks, devoured the feast, of
         which they did not taste a single morsel. Some share of the pork was given to Orea's wife
         and daughter, who carefully wrapped it up, in order to eat it apart. Thus it seems, that
         though the hog was wholly dressed, prepared, and distributed by men, yet this did not make
         it improper for the women to partake of it. At other times, it appears, that different
         persons cannot eat what has been touched by one or other of the same family ; we are
         therefore unable to conceive by what rule their custom of eating separately is conducted.
         The Taheitians are not the only people who do not eat with their women; several nations of
         negroes, and even the natives of Labrador, have adopted the same idea. From the general
         conduct of these African and Eskimaux tribes, an unnatural contempt for the sex appears to
         be their motive for this unsociable custom. But as the Taheitian women are very kindly
         treated, and highly esteemed by the men, the custom must have some other origin among them,
         which a connected series of accurate observations may perhaps in time lead us to
         discover.</p>

      <p>The captain had taken with him a few bottles of brandy, which, mixed with water, makes the
         favourite liquor of sailors, called grog. The arreoys and some other chiefs, finding it
         strong, and almost as nauseous as their pepper-root drink, drank very freely of it, and
         afterwards took some small cups of pure brandy, which they relished so well, and repeated
         so often, that they were soon obliged to lie down to sleep. We returned to the ship about
         five o'clock in the afternoon; and the day being remarkably warm, we went ashore to bathe
         in a beautiful fountain, which we had constantly made use of for that purpose during our
         stay. A fragrant shrubbery hung round it, screening from the sun the water, which was
         temperately cool, and perfectly limpid. We found the use of this bath extremely refreshing;
         and the natives had probably experienced the same effect, as they constantly resorted to it
         every morning and evening. Such pleasing spots are frequent in these islands; they
         contribute greatly to their embellishment, and without doubt, are instrumental in
         preserving the health of the inhabitants.</p>

      <p>We passed the next days in various excursions towards the hills, where we collected a few
         plants, which we had not met with before. These hills exactly resembled those of Taheitee,
         but were somewhat lower. We found a romantic valley between them, surrounded by a forest of
         various trees and shrubs, and furnished with a beautiful rivulet, which fell in many
         cascades over broken rocks and precipices.</p>

      <p><date>[1774. June.][Thusday 2.]</date>On our returning from our last walk, we received a
         very interesting piece of intelligence from the natives. One of them, just arrived from the
         island Huahine, told us that two ships lay at anchor there, one of them considerably larger
         than ours, but the other about the same size. Captain Cook called the man into his cabin,
         where he repeated the same story to us, and confirmed it, by asserting that he had been on
         board the lesser ship, and had been made drunk there. We enquired for the names of the
         captains, and he told us that of the greater ship was Tabane, and the other Tonno. These
         were the names by which the natives designed Mr. Banks and captain Furneaux. Captain Cook
         was therefore surprised to hear them named, and enquired of what stature these persons
         were. The native very readily told us, that the one whom he called Tabane was a tall man,
         but the other considerably less. This answer corresponded extremely well with truth; but as
         it was very improbable that captain Furneaux would remain at Huahine, after hearing that
         his senior officer lay so near him, we concluded that the ships must belong to some other
         nation. At our return to the Cape of Good Hope, we heard that captain Furneaux had sailed
         from that settlement long before the time when he was supposed to be at Huahine, and that
         Mr. Banks had not left Europe. We have since learnt that M. St. Denis a French navigator,
         has been in the South Seas at the time in question with two ships.</p>

      <p>The chief, O-Rea, at first confirmed this news, but afterwards suspecting that it might
         hasten our departure, he was unwilling to give his opinion, and seeming to doubt of the
         truth of the report, always abruptly changed the subject of conversation, with all the art
         of an European politician.</p>

      <p>The next day the natives came in great numbers to the ship with abundance of provisions,
         which they sold very <date>[Friday 3.]</date>cheap, as captain Cook proposed to sail the
         next day. His store of hatchets and knives had been expended long ago; our armourer was
         therefore set to work to make new ones, which were ill-shapen, and of very little worth,
         particularly the knives, which were made of pieces of iron hoops. The natives were
         contented with them, not knowing how to distinguish the good from the bad by the eye. They
         sometimes picked our pockets, or stole what we did not sufficiently look after; but their
         simplicity now gave room for a severe retaliation.</p>

      <p>Among the natives of the Society Islands there are a few men who preserve the national
         traditions, together with all their ideas of mythology and astronomy. Mahine, whilst we
         were at sea, had frequently spoken of them as the most learned of his countrymen, and named
         them Tata-o-Rerro, which we would express by teachers. After much enquiry, we found a
         chief, named Tootavaï, in the district of Hamaneno, who was distinguished by this epithet.
         As our departure was so near at hand, we regretted that we had not known him sooner; but my
         father determined to employ his remaining time in making enquiries on a subject so
         interesting as the history of religious opinions.</p>

      <p>Tootavaï was pleased with an opportunity of displaying his knowledge; he was flattered with
         the attention which we paid to his words, and therefore continued to converse on the same
         subject with much greater patience and perseverance, than we could have expected from a
         lively inhabitant of these islands. The religion of the islanders appears to be as singular
         a system of polytheism as ever was invented. Few nations are so wretched, and so wholly
         occupied with the means of preserving their existence, as to lay aside all ideas of a
         creator. These ideas rather seem to have remained traditionally among mankind, ever since
         the first ages, when the Deity revealed himself. Agreeably to this opinion, the people of
         Taheitee and the Society Islands have preserved this spark of divine instruction, and
         believe the existence of a Supreme Being, the maker and progenitor of all things, visible
         and invisible. It has been the fate of most nations to investigate more or less the
         qualities of this universal and incomprehensible spirit, and to adopt absurdities, by
         overstepping the bounds prescribed by the Creator himself to our senses and mental
         faculties. The different attributes of the Deity were soon personified by narrow minds,
         which could not contain the vast idea of supreme perfection. Gods and goddesses then became
         innumerable, and one error still gave birth to many more. Man, in the course of education,
         received from his father the knowledge of a God; and a spontaneous principle within him
         cherished this idea. Population encreased, the distinctions of ranks took place, and
         proportionately influenced the gratification of the senses. In every society, some
         individual or other took advantage of the general propensity to adore, endeavoured to
         captivate the judgment of the multitude, and by misrepresenting and separating the
         qualities of the Almighty, converted the filial affection of mankind towards their
         benefactor into a jealous dread of his anger. At the Society Islands I apprehend this to be
         the case: they adore divinities of all sorts and qualities; but what is most singular,
         every island has a separate theogony. This will appear more clearly by comparing the
         following account with the observations on their religion in captain Cook's first voyage .
         Tootavàï began with telling us, that in every island of this group, they gave the supreme
         God, creator of earth and skies, a different name; or, to express it more clearly, that in
         every island they believe a different deity, though always one of those which are known to
         them all, to hold the first rank. Thus at Taheitee and Eimeo, they say the Supreme Being is
         O-Rooa-hattoo; at Huahine they maintain that it is Tanè; at Raietea, O-Roò; at O-Tahà,
         Orra; at Bolabola, Taoòtoo; at Mowrua, O-Too; and at Tabbooa-mannoo (Sir Charles Saunders's
         Island) Taròä. Thirteen divinities preside over the sea, and govern it; viz. 1.
         Ooroohàddoo. 2. Tama-ooee. 3. Ta-apèe. 4. O-Tooareeònoo. 5. Tanèea. 6. Tahou-meònna. 7.
         Orà-mauwe. 8. O-Whaï. 9. O-Whàtta. 10. Tahòoa. 11. Te-ootya. 12. O-Mahooroo. 13. O-Whàddoo.
         But notwithstanding all these governors, a different divinity, Oo-marrèo, is said to have
         created the sea. The same case exists with regard to the sun, which was created by
         O-Maïwee, a powerful god, who causes earthquakes. The divinity which resides in, and
         governs the sun, is called Tootòomo-hororìrree. They have ventured to attribute to this
         deity a beautiful human form, whose hair descends down to his feet. They assert, that the
         deceased go thither to dwell with him, and are continually feasted there with bread-fruit
         and pork, which need no preparation from the fire. They believe every man to have a
         separate being within him, named Tee and lodges in the wooden images, which are placed
         round the burying-places, and which are called by the same name, tee. Thus the belief of a
         future existence, and that of the combination of matter and spirit, have reached the
         remotest islands of the earth. Whether they have any idea of rewards and punishments in a
         future state, we could not learn; but it is most reasonable to suppose that such ideas have
         occurred to a nation so far advanced as the Taheitians. The moon was created by a female
         divinity, named O-Heenna, who likewise governs that planet, and resides in its black spot
         or cloud. The women sing a short couplet, which seems to be an act of adoration paid to
         that divinity, perhaps because they suppose her to have some influence upon their physical
         œconomy.</p>

      <p>We may venture to suppose, that the Taheitian goddess of the moon is not the chaste Diana
         of the ancients, but rather the Phœnician Astarte. The stars were created by a goddess
         called Tettoo-mataròu, and the winds are governed by the god Orree-òrree.</p>

      <p>Besides these greater divinities, they have a considerable number of inferior orders, some
         of whom are said to be mischievous, and to kill men in their sleep.24 They are worshipped
         publicly at the principal maraïs, or monuments of stone, by the Tahowa-rahaï, or
         high-priest of the island.25 The beneficent gods are addressed in prayers, which are not
         pronounced aloud, but are distinguished and made known only by the motion of the lips. The
         priest looks up to the skies, and the eatua, or god, is supposed to come down and hold
         converse with him, unseen by all the people, and heard by none but the priest himself.
         Surely this is an evident mark of the influence of priestcraft, whose great aim is ever to
         veil religion in mystery. From a principle directly opposite to this, the Christian
         doctrine derives one of those incontestible characters of a divine origin, which
         distinguish it from all the deceitful inventions of human understanding, and carry
         persuasion to the mind. This religion does not wear the mysterious cloak, which can only
         serve to cover darkness, but appears to us divested of all kinds of trappings, and throws a
         pure and steady light around. It admits of no mystery, and its true and venerable ministers
         have at all times assured and convinced us, that they reserved no private knowledge for
         themselves, which was not communicated to the meanest of those who bow the knee to their
         pure and divine Creator; " for all shall know him, from the least to the greatest." Hebr.
         viii. ii.</p>

      <p>Offerings are made to the gods, of hogs and poultry roasted, and of all kinds of eatables;
         but the inferior, and particularly the malevolent spirits, are only revered by a kind of
         hissing. Some of these spirits are said to come into the houses of the natives at night,
         and to kill them; others are said to inhabit a certain deserted island named Mannua,26
         where they are visible in the shape of strong, tall men, with fiery eyes, and devour those
         who happen to approach their coast: but this rather alludes to the anthropophagy, which, as
         I have before observed, seems to have existed at these islands, previous to their present
         state of civilization.27 A number of plants are particularly sacred to the deities. The
         casuarina, the coco-palm, and the banana, are frequently planted near maraïs, or public
         places of worship. A species of cratœva, a sort of pepper, the hibiscus populneus, the
         dracœna terminalis, and the calophyllum, are all found in the same places, and are alike
         considered as signs of peace and friendship. Some birds, such as a species of heron,
         king's-fisher, and cuckoo, are also consecrated to the deity; but I have already mentioned,
         that they are not held in equal veneration by all the people; and it is also to be
         observed, that different islands protect different birds.</p>

      <p>The priests of these islands continue in office during their life, and their dignity is
         hereditary. The high-priest of every island is always an aree, who has the highest rank
         after the king. They are consulted upon many important occasions, partake largely of the
         good things of the country, and in short have found means to make themselves necessary.
         Besides the priests, there is also in every district one or two teachers, or tata-o-rerro,
         like Tootavaï, who are skilled in theogony and cosmogony, and at certain times instruct the
         people in these things. The same persons likewise preserve the knowledge of geography,
         together with their ideas of astronomy and the division of time. They have the names of
         fourteen lunar months, in the following order:28 1. O-Pororo-moòa. 2. O-Pororo-mooree. 3.
         Moorehàh. 4. Oohee-eiya. 5. O-Whirre-ammà;. 6. Taòwa. 7. O-Whirre-erre-erre. 8. O-Tearree.
         9. Ote-tàï. 10. Wàrehoo. 11. Wàhou. 12. Pippirree. 13. E-Oonoònoo. 14. Oo-mannoo. The first
         seven months collectively are called Ooroo, or a bread-fruit season; but in what manner
         they arrange these months, in order to effect a complete cycle or a year, is a mystery to
         us at present. It should seem that some of the months, especially the second and seventh,
         are intercalary, from the resemblance of their names to those of the first and fifth, and
         that they are inserted in different years. Each of the lunations consists of twenty-nine
         days. During the two last days of the lunation, they say the moon is dead, because it does
         not appear; it is therefore plain that they begin to count from the moon's first
         appearance, and not from the real time of the conjunction. The twenty-fifth day of the
         thirteenth moon, E-Oonoonoo, was our third of June, when we obtained this information.</p>

      <p>The name of tahowa, which the Taheitians apply to priests, is not entirely confined to
         them, but is also given to those persons who know the virtues of a few plants, which are
         used as remedies against different disorders. Their medicines are few, and very simple, but
         their diseases are not manifold and complicated.</p>

      <p>As soon as we had obtained these accounts from Tootavaï, the ship unmoored, on the fourth
         of June, about ten in the morning. The king of Raietea, Oo-ooroo, to whom the conqueror
         O-Poonee had left the title and honour of royalty, visited us with some of his relations,
         just before our departure. O-Rea with his family was likewise on board, and Mahine with his
         relations came to take their leave. The parting scene was extremely affecting; all our
         friends shed tears plentifully, but poor Mahine's heart seemed torn to pieces by the
         violence of his grief. He ran from cabin to cabin, and embraced every one of us, without
         being able to speak a single word. His tears, his sighs and looks were eloquent beyond
         description. At last the ship set sail; he got into his canoe, and continued standing
         upright, whilst all his countrymen were seated. He looked at us, then hung down his head,
         and hid it in his garments. When we had cleared the reefs, we still perceived him to wave
         his extended arms; and he continued his addresses till we could no longer discern him.</p>

      <p>Thus we left an amiable nation, who, with all their imperfections, are perhaps more
         innocent and pure of heart, than those who are more refined and better instructed. Without
         quoting the example of Mahine, we have often been witnesses to reciprocal acts of
         kindness,. which convinced us, that the social virtues are frequently exercised amongst
         themselves. I have seen a single bread-fruit, or a few coco-nuts shared between a number of
         people, so that every one partook of them. I have observed them parting with their cloaths,
         and doing several charitable actions to each other, with the same good-will which they
         expressed towards us. We should indeed be ungrateful, if we did not acknowledge the
         kindness with which they always treated us; they were ready to carry us on their backs in
         and out of our boats, to prevent the surf from wetting our feet; they often loaded
         themselves with the curiosities which we had purchased; and rarely refused to go into the
         water in quest of any bird which we had shot. If the rain caught us on our excursions, or
         the heat of the sun and the fatigue of the journey oppressed us, we were invited to repose
         in their dwellings, and feasted on their best provisions; our friendly host stood at a
         distance, and never tasted any thing till we entreated him; whilst some of the family were
         employed in fanning us with a leaf, or the bough of a tree. Before we left the house we
         were commonly adopted, according to our different ages, in the quality of fathers,
         brothers, or sons.30 This circumstance was owing to an opinion that we were all related.
         The chiefs in all the Society Islands are descended from the same family; our officers,
         therefore, and all those who dined or messed together, were by them considered as
         relations. They supposed that captain Cook and my father were brothers, purely from this
         reason; for, with all their good heart, they are but indifferent physiognomists. Their
         hospitality towards us was frequently quite disinterested; and gave us a right to form the
         most flattering conclusions in regard to their conduct towards each other. They are
         hospitable without seeming to know it; and leave to strangers who visit them, the pleasing
         and grateful task of recording their virtues.</p>

      <head>CHAP. VIII.</head>

      <p><date>[1774. June.]</date>WE fired a salute of several guns on leaving the island of
         Raietea, <date>[Saturday 4.]</date>in honour of his majesty's birth day; and this discharge
         of our artillery afforded no small entertainment to the inhabitants. During the six weeks
         which we had spent at Taheitee and the Society Islands, we had been well refreshed, and
         were perfectly recovered from our bilious and scorbutic complaints: a venereal disorder
         was, however, the reward of those, that.</p>

      <p>Nearly one half of our crew were afflicted with this nauseous and shameful disease; though
         it was in general less virulent than in Europe. Our conversations with Mahine on its
         ravages, gave us the greatest reason to be convinced, that it existed at Taheitee and the
         Society Islands previous to captain Wallis's voyage in 1768. Mahine frequently assured us,
         that several years before that period, his mother died of this disease at Borabora. Its
         appearance has therefore been attributed to a wrong cause in various parts of the world.
         For the space of near three centuries the Spaniards have been accused by physicians, and
         detested by moralists, for bringing the infection from America, which is now
         incontrovertibly proved to have begun in Europe, previous to the discovery of America. The
         English and French navigators have charged each other with the introduction of this
         detestable disorder among the harmless and hospitable Taheitians; though they have long
         been acquainted with it, and are not ignorant of the art of curing it . Nay, it seems that
         their simple diet, the salubrity of their climate, and a long space of time, have abated
         the acrimony of the virus, and brought it to that inactive state to which it is now reduced
         in South America. I am far from supposing, that the venereal complaint has been carried to
         America from Europe; no, the same causes which could give birth to it in one part of the
         world, are sufficient to produce it every where else. The commerce of our crews with the
         women of Tonga Tabboo, and the Marquesas: nay, their remarkable connections with the
         salacious females of Easter Island, had no sinister consequences. It may be inferred from
         thence, that the infection has not yet broke out at those islands, though such inferences
         are sometimes fallacious ; for captain Wallis left Taheitee without having a single
         venereal patient, though the distemper is now proved to have existed there before his
         arrival. It is also beyond a doubt, that the New Zeelanders were afflicted with this
         disorder before any Europeans had an intercourse with them.</p>

      <p>We passed the island of Mowrua in the afternoon, and stood to the westward with a
         favourable trade-wind. On the 6th, at eleven in the morning, we descried an island, which
         captain Wallis named after lord Howe. It is very low, consisting of coral ledges, which
         enclose a lagoon; and by its direction, it appears to be the same which the natives of the
         Society Islands call Mopeehàh. We found it situated in 16° 46' S. lat. and 154° 8' W.
         Several birds, called boobies,3 were seen in the neighbourhood of this little isle, which
         was to appearance uninhabited.</p>

      <p><date>[Tuesday 7.]</date>The next day at noon the wind shifted, and became contrary. During
         the whole afternoon it thundered and lightned, and we had several smart showers. The night
         was calm; but we fixed the electric chain at the mast-head, on account of the strong
         lightning which still continued. We had so faint a breeze, with intervening calms, during
         the next three days, that we made but slow advances. Tropic-birds and noddies visited us
         during this time; and our crew had the mortification of losing a great shark, after they
         had hooked and shot him with three bullets.</p>

      <p>On the 11th, in the morning, the wind freshened again, and pushed us on to the W. S. W. for
         two days, at the expiration of which we had calms and foul winds to cope with, and saw
         frequent flashes of lightning at night. Seafowl of different sorts, and fishes, such as
         bonitos, dolphins, sharks, and grampusses, appeared about us at different times.</p>

      <p><date>[Thursday 16.]</date>On the 16th, in the morning, at eight o'clock, we discovered
         another low island. We were close to it about three in the afternoon, and sailed round it,
         without finding a landing place or harbour. It consisted of eight different isles,
         connected by reefs, and covered with trees, particularly coco-palms, which made it look
         remarkably pleasant. Vast flocks of aquatic birds appeared about it, from whence we
         concluded, that it was likewise uninhabited. In some parts there were extensive sandy
         beaches, where turtles probably resort to lay their eggs. The sea was also full of good
         fish, of different sorts, about us. This pretty little spot was named Palmerston Island,
         and lies in 18° 4' S. lat. and 163° 10' W. </p>

      <p><date>[Monday 20.]</date>We continued steering to the W. S. W. till the 20th, when we saw
         an island in the afternoon,4 of some elevation, on which, before sunset, we could discern
         the trees. We tacked all night to windward, and at the return of daylight stood towards it.
         Having approached within about two miles, we ran along the shore, which now appeared steep
         and rocky, with here and there a narrow sandy beach at the foot of the rock. It was nearly
         level every where, and its greatest height seemed not to exceed forty feet; but it was
         covered with woods and shrubberies along the summit. About ten o'clock, we perceived seven
         or eight people running close to the water's edge. They seemed to be of a blackish colour,
         and were naked; something white was wrapped about their heads and loins, and each had a
         spear, a club, or a paddle in his hand. In several chasms between the rocks, we observed a
         few small canoes hauled upon the shore. We now likewise took notice of some coco-nut trees,
         of no great height, which stood on the slope of the rocks. Two boats were hoisted out,
         armed and manned, in which the captain, accompanied by Dr. Sparrman, Mr. Hodges, my father,
         and myself, went ashore. A reef of coral surrounds the whole coast at a short distance; but
         having found an opening, where the surf was not dangerous, we landed, and climbed up one of
         the adjacent rocks, where we posted some of our sailors and marines. It consisted entirely
         of sharp and craggy coral, and was covered with a variety of small shrubby plants, common
         to the low islands. Besides these, we found some new species, all which grew between the
         crevices of the coral, without the least atom of soil. Some curlews, snipes, and herons, of
         the same sort which we had observed at Taheitee, likewise appeared on this island. Having
         walked among the bushes, at the distance of about fifty yards from the water, we heard a
         loud halloo, upon which we retired to the rock, where our people had taken post. We now
         learnt that captain Cook, having walked up a long deep gulley, which lay before us, had
         entered the woods at a little distance from us. He had not proceeded far, when he heard
         somebody tumbling down from a tree. He supposed it was one of us, and called out to us, but
         was presently undeceived by the shouts of the Indian. We now called to the natives in those
         South Sea dialects which we were acquainted with, that we were friends, and desired them to
         come down to us. They were heard talking and shouting to each other for some time; and
         presently one of them appeared at the entrance of the gulley. His body was blackened as far
         as the waist; his head was ornamented with feathers placed upright, and in his hand he held
         a spear. Behind him we heard many voices in the chasm, though the trees prevented our
         seeing the people. At last a young man, to all appearance without a beard, stepped forward,
         and joined the first. He was like him blackened, and had a long bow, like those of
         Tonga-Tabboo, in his right hand. With the left he instantly flung a very large stone, with
         so much accuracy, as to hit Dr. Sparrman's arm a violent blow, at the distance of forty
         yards. The pain which it occasioned irritated my friend so much, that he let fly at his
         enemy; but it did not appear that the small shot had any effect. Both the natives retired
         soon after; and though we staid here for some time, performing the idle ceremony of taking
         possession, we saw nothing more of the inhabitants. After we had resumed our course along
         shore in the boats, we saw the people coming to the water's side at the place which we had
         left. The appearance of the coast was still the same as we advanced. We landed at the
         hazard of our necks in another place, which we left as soon as the boat's crew called out,
         that they perceived the natives above us. We continued till we came to a considerable chasm
         in the rock, before which a flat reef, full of holes and cavities, extended about fifty
         yards off shore. We drew up a line of sailors on the reef, and the captain with us walked
         into the chasm, where we found four canoes. They were very nearly of the same structure
         with those of Tonga-Tabboo, and had some carving, but were not so neatly wrought. They were
         single, and had strong out-riggers. Some were covered with coarse mats, and contained
         fishing-lines, spears, and pieces of wood, which appeared to have served as matches for
         fishing at night. The captain laid a small present of beads, nails, and medals on each
         canoe; but whilst he was so employed, I perceived a troop of natives coming down the chasm,
         and instantly acquainting our company of it, we all retired a few steps. Two of the
         natives, dressed with feathers, and blackened as the other before mentioned, advanced
         towards us with furious shouts, and spears in their hands. We called in friendly terms to
         them; but to no purpose. The captain endeavoured to discharge his musket, but it missed
         fire. He desired us to fire in our own defence, and the same thing happened to us all. The
         natives threw two spears: captain Cook narrowly escaped one of them by stooping; the other
         slid along my thigh, marking my cloaths with the black colour with which it was daubed. We
         tried to fire again, and at last my piece, loaded with small shot, went off, and Mr. Hodges
         fired a ball, which did no execution. At the same time a regular firing began behind us
         from our party, who having observed our retreat, had likewise viewed another troop of the
         natives coming down by a different path to cut us off. The effect of the small shot
         fortunately stopped the natives from rushing upon us, and gave us time to retreat to our
         men, who continued to fire with great eagerness, while any of the natives remained in
         sight. Two of these in particular, standing among the bushes, brandished their weapons in
         defiance a considerable while, but at last retired, one of them appearing to be wounded, by
         the dismal howl which we heard presently after. We now embarked, and resolved to abandon a
         set of people, whom no entreaties could prevail upon to become our friends. The nature of
         their country, which is almost inaccessible, seems to have contributed to make their
         tempers so unsociable. The whole island is purely a coral-rock, like that of the low
         islands, on which we saw very few coco-palms, and no useful trees. I have therefore formed
         a conjecture, that the interior parts are not so barren, but fit for the culture of
         nutritive vegetables. The general resemblance of this island to a coral ledge raised out of
         the water, almost leads me to suspect that it includes a fertile plain, which was once a
         lagoon.5 Whether a convulsion of the globe, or any other cause, lifted such a large piece
         of coral-rock forty feet above water, is a point which must be left to future philosophers
         to determine. The boats and arms of the natives resembled those of Tonga-Tabboo, and it is
         therefore probable that the people have the same origin; but their numbers are
         inconsiderable, and their civilization little advanced, since they are savage, and go
         naked. Their island seems to be about three leagues long, and was called Savage Island. It
         is situated in 19° 1' S. and 169° 37' W. </p>

      <p>Having reached the ship, the boats were hoisted in, and the next morning we continued our
         course to the westward. A large high-finned whale, which was seen near the ship, spouted up
         the water, and several birds and fish attended us as usual.</p>

      <p>On the twenty-fourth at night we lay to, as we expected to be very near A Namoka, or
         Rotterdam Island, one of the Friendly Isles discovered by Tasman in 1643. Breakers were
         heard a-head at two o'clock, and the land appeared at day-break. <date>[Saturday
            25.]</date>We stood for it, and soon found it to consist of several low islands,
         connected by a vast reef. Another great reef lay to the northward, and we passed between
         them. At noon a canoe came off towards us, though the nearest land was above a league
         distant. We discerned two men in it, who stood on a long while, but at last, seeing that
         the ship gained upon them, they put about and returned. We could not help admiring the
         difference between this race, and the savages whom we had so lately left, and agreed that
         the name Friendly was very justly given to them. The wind slackened all the afternoon, and
         died away to a perfect calm during night. We approached so near one of the reefs by this
         means, that we ran great risk of being wrecked; but a breeze springing up in the morning,
         we were out of danger in a short time.</p>

      <p><date>[Sunday 26.]</date>The next morning we sailed between reefs and small islands, which
         made the water smooth. The islands had a little more elevation than the common coral
         islands; they were covered with groves and tufts of trees, which gave them a most
         enchanting appearance. The houses were seen in great numbers among the trees on the beach,
         and the islands had an air of happiness and affluence. One of these little gardens rose at
         its east end into a white perpendicular cliff, with something like horizontal strata. At
         our distance it looked like the bastion of a ruined fort, and being fringed with woods and
         palms, formed altogether a romantic view. Towards noon the wind slackened, and canoes put
         off from different islands to visit us, though they were above a league distant. Some of
         them worked so hard, that they were near us in less than an hour; and when they were about
         a musket-shot off, they began to call to us from time to time, still continuing to paddle
         towards us. Three persons were in the canoe, exactly like the natives of Eä-oowhe and
         Tonga-Tabboo, whom we had seen in October, 1773. When they were along-side, a few beads and
         nails were presented to them, for which they immediately sent a bunch of bananas, and some
         delicious shaddocks (citrus decumanus) on the deck, besides a bunch of the red fruits of
         the palm-nut tree or pandang (athrodactylis) which is a sign of friendship. This being
         done, they sold us all the shaddocks and fruit which they had, and came on board. In the
         mean while the other canoes arrived, and acted without the least caution, as if we had been
         long acquainted. They taught us the names of all the islands in the neighbourhood; that
         with the high cliff they called Terrefetchéâ; the other, which we admired so much for its
         beauty, Tonooméa: both these lay to the eastward of us. Mango-nooe (great) and Mango-eetee
         (little) were two islands to the west of us; and to the S. W. beyond them lay Namoka-nooee
         and Namoka-eetee; the first of which Tasman has called Rotterdam Island, or Anamocka.</p>

      <p>After dinner the breeze freshened, and we sailed towards Namoka, which was the largest
         island of this group. The number of canoes encreased about us; they came from all the
         neighbouring islands with fruit, fish, and pigs, all which they disposed of for nails and
         rags.</p>

      <p>We had soundings all the day between these islands, at first in forty and fifty, and
         afterwards, when we came nearer, in nine, twelve, fourteen, and twenty fathom. About four
         o'clock, having hauled round the south end of Namoka, we came to, on the lee or west side
         of it, where Tasman formerly lay. Our distance from the shore was about a mile. The coast
         of the island rose fifteen or twenty feet nearly perpendicular, after which it appeared
         almost level, having only a single hillock near the middle. This steep shore had some
         resemblance to the coast of Savage Island, which we had lately left, but the richness of
         its woods was infinitely greater. Innumerable coco-nut palms out-topped the woods, and
         ornamented the island on all sides.</p>

      <p>Whilst we were coming to an anchor, one of the natives caught the lead, and tore the line
         which one of our people was heaving. He was desired to return it, but took no notice of the
         captain who spoke to him. A musket with ball was fired through his canoe; upon which he
         calmly removed to the other side of the ship. Our demand was repeated, and proving
         ineffectual again, was enforced by a load of small-shot, which made him smart. He instantly
         paddled to the head of the ship, where a rope hung overboard, to which he tied the line and
         lead. His countrymen were not satisfied with this restitution; they turned him out of his
         canoe, and made him swim on shore, whilst they continued to trade with us. They sold us
         coco-nuts, excellent yams, bread fruit, bananas, shaddocks, and other fruit. They also
         brought purple water-hens6 alive, and a fine well-tasted sparus7ready dressed in leaves;
         also a curious stringy root baked, which contained a very nourishing pulp, of such a
         sweetness, as if it had been boiled in sugar. All these things were eagerly bought for
         nails, which were esteemed according to their size, and for pieces of our cloth. Their
         canoes, their persons, dress, customs and language so entirely resembled those of
         Tonga-Tabboo, that we could perceive no difference. As this island is at a short distance
         from Namoka, it is not improbable that the inhabitants of the latter might have heard of
         our arrival there in October, 1773.</p>

      <p><date>[Monday 27.]</date>The next morning captain Cook landed early in a sandy cove, which
         is accurately described by Tasman.8 It is enclosed by a reef, and has a narrow entrance for
         boats at the south end. It is so shallow, that our boats could only come in at high water.
         The captain purchased a pig, and was conducted to a pond of fresh water at a short distance
         from the beach, the same where Tasman had supplied his ships with water. The hospitality of
         the natives was exercised in its utmost extent, and one of the handsomest ladies of the
         island complimented the captain with an offer, which was not accepted. Having examined the
         watering-place, he returned on board to breakfast, and gave strict orders, that no person
         infected with or lately cured of venereal complaints should be suffered to go on shore, and
         that no woman should be admitted in the ship. A number of ladies came off in several
         canoes, and seemed very desirous of making acquaintance with our sailors; but after
         paddling about the ship for some time, they were obliged to return to the shore, very much
         discontented. Immediately after breakfast, Dr. Sparrman, my father and myself accompanied
         captain Cook to the shore, where a trade commenced for shaddocks and yams, which the
         natives sold us in prodigious quantities. Bananas and coco-nuts were scarce in proportion,
         and bread-fruit still more rare, though the trees of these sorts were very numerous. All
         the men went nearly naked, a slight covering on the loins excepted; a few of them, however,
         and most of the women, were drest from the waist to the ancles, in a piece of stiff painted
         cloth made of bark, wrapped several times round them, or in mats.</p>

      <p>As soon as our boats reached the shore, the clamours of all those who had something to sell
         became so excessively loud, that we hastened into the country, whose aspect was very
         inviting. A considerable variety of plants covered the ground in wild luxuriance; and the
         great number of plantations of all sorts, made the whole island resemble a beautiful
         garden. The fences which had confined the view at Tonga-Tabboo, were here much less
         frequent, and only enclosed one side of the path, leaving the other open to the eye. The
         ground was not perfectly level in the interior parts, but rose in several little hillocks
         lined with hedges and bushes, which formed a most agreeable prospect. The path which we met
         with, sometimes went under long rows of lofty trees, planted at considerable distances,
         between which the ground was covered with the richest verdure; sometimes a thick and
         impenetrable arbour of fragrant shrubberies vaulted over it for a considerable space, and
         hid it entirely from the sun; sometimes plantations, and sometimes wilds appeared on both
         sides. The houses of the natives were of a singular structure:9 their height was about
         eight or nine feet; but the walls, which were not perpendicular, but converged towards the
         bottom, were not above three or four feet from the ground, and very neatly made of reeds.
         The roof converged into a ridge at the top; so that the section of the house resembled a
         pentagon. It was thatched, and the roof projected beyond the sloping walls of the house. In
         one of the long sides there was always an opening about two feet square, and eighteen
         inches from the ground, which served instead of a door. The length of the house never
         exceeded thirty feet, and the breadth was commonly eight or nine. The inside of these
         houses was always filled with large roots of yams, which seem to be the chief support of
         the natives. To sleep upon them must be extremely uncomfortable; and yet a few mats are
         only spread over them at night, which custom has made acceptable to these people. Those
         narrow little stools, on which the Taheitians rest the head, are extremely frequent here,
         and serve the same purpose. We also observed several open sheds, on a few posts, like some
         which we had seen at Tonga-Tabboo. These were laid out with mats, and seemed to be intended
         for their abode in the day-time. In our ramble we passed by a number of these habitations,
         but saw very few inhabitants, they being mostly at the trading place. Those whom we met
         were always very civil, and bowed their heads, saying, leleï (good), woä (friend), or some
         such word, to mark their good temper and disposition.10 They were our conductors; they
         brought us flowers from the highest trees, and birds out of the water; they often pointed
         out the finest plants to us, and taught us their names; we needed only to shew them a
         plant, of which we wished to have specimens, and they would go to any distance to procure
         it. Coco-nuts and shaddocks they readily offered to us; and willingly carried great loads
         for us; a nail, a bead, or even a small rag of cloth, being considered as a valuable
         present in return. In a word, they were on all occasions ready to oblige us.</p>

      <p>In the course of our walk we found a large lake or lagoon of salt-water, at the north end
         of the island, which at one place reached within a few yards of the sea. It was about three
         miles long, and one wide. Three little islands full of trees, arranged in the most
         picturesque manner, served to ornament this fine piece of water, of which the shores also
         captivated the eye by their variety and beauty. The inverted landscape on the water,11
         rendered this scene still more beautiful, especially as our point of view was an eminence,
         where many tall trees and thick shrubberies screened us from the sun.</p>

      <p>No island, which we had hitherto visited, had offered so great variety of views to us in so
         small a space; nay, we had no where found such abundance of beautiful flowers, so agreeably
         contrasting their various tints, and mingling their sweet scents to perfume the air. The
         lake was full of wild-ducks, and the woods and shores abounded with pigeons, parroquets,
         rails, and small birds, which the natives brought for sale.</p>

      <p>At noon we returned to the trading place, where captain Cook had purchased a great quantity
         of fruit and roots, a few fowls, and one or two small pigs. When we arrived on board, we
         found they had been equally successful there in the purchase of provisions. The whole poop
         was loaded with shaddocks, which we found a most delicious fruit, of excellent flavour; and
         of yams we had laid in such a quantity, that we eat of them every day for several weeks
         afterwards instead of biscuit. Arms and utensils, the usual articles of trade of these
         islanders, had likewise been plentifully sold, especially by several people who came in
         large double sailing canoes from the neighbouring islands. While we were at dinner, one of
         our shipmates was observed on shore, surrounded by a great croud of natives; but no further
         notice was taken of him, though he made signals for a boat. One of our trading boats, which
         was sent ashore as soon as the crew had dined, came near the place where he was stationed,
         and took him on board. It proved to be our surgeon, Mr. Patton, who had been in the most
         imminent danger of losing his life, by being carelessly left upon the island without
         support. From his account it is very plain, that even among these kind and well-disposed
         people, there were some villains who greatly resembled the wretches that infest our
         civilized countries. He had left the landing place, and engaging a single native in his
         service for a few beads, had rambled over great part of the island. His success in shooting
         was considerable; the native carried eleven ducks, with which he returned to the sandy
         cove. The boats having already left that place, he was something disconcerted, and the
         croud pressed about him, conscious that he was in their power. He walked therefore to the
         rocky shore, just abreast of the ship, where our people saw him. In going thither, the man
         who carried the ducks endeavoured to drop some of them; but Mr. Patton luckily turning
         about at that moment, he picked them up again. The croud now pressed close about him, and
         several of the men threatened him with jagged spears, whilst nothing but the appearance of
         his fowling-piece kept them in awe. Several women were set on by the men, to draw him off
         his guard, by a thousand lascivious gestures and attitudes; but his situation was of too
         serious a nature to permit him to attend to them. After some time a canoe arrived from the
         ship, and Mr. Patton agreed with the owner to carry him aboard for a nail, the last which
         he had left. Just as he was stepping into the canoe, they snatched his fowling-piece from
         him, took all his ducks except three, and sent away the canoe. He was greatly astonished
         and alarmed, and resolved to return to the top of the rock, where he expected to be more
         easily distinguished from the ship, from whence he hoped for assistance. The natives now
         laid aside all reserve, and began to pluck at his cloaths. He readily suffered them to
         snatch his cravat and handkerchief; but they also seized his coat, and resumed their
         threatening gestures with such violence, that he expected every moment would be his last.
         His anxiety and agony cannot well be painted. He put his hands in all his pockets to search
         for some instrument, a knife or the like, with which to defend himself; he found nothing
         but a wretched tooth-pick case; he opened it, and held it out upon the croud, who
         perceiving it hollow, instantly slew back to the distance of two or three yards: he
         continued to point this formidable weapon against the enemy, whose spears were still lifted
         against him. The meridian sun shone burning hot upon him; he had walked the whole day, was
         spent with fatigue, and began to despair of saving his life, when a handsome young woman,
         remarkable for her flowing curls, which hung down on her bosom, took pity on his wretched
         condition. She stepped forward from the croud, with the greatest humanity and compassion
         expressed in her eye; innocence and goodness were so strongly marked in her countenance,
         that it was impossible to distrust her. She approached, and offered him a piece of
         shaddock, which was eagerly and thankfully accepted; and gradually supplied him with more,
         till he had consumed the whole fruit. At last the boats put off from the ship, at sight of
         which the whole croud dispersed; only his generous benefactress, and an old man, who was
         her father, remained sitting near Mr. Patton, with that unconcern which a noble and
         virtuous conduct inspires. She enquired for the name of her friend; he told her that which
         the Taheitians had given him, Pateenee; and she immediately adopted it, changing it into
         Patseenee. On stepping into the boat, he gave her father and her a few presents, which he
         borrowed from the crew, and with these they returned to their groves highly pleased. When
         Mr. Patton came on board, he acquainted captain Cook with the danger to which he had been
         exposed; but though he had only followed the example of many of his shipmates, by reposing
         confidence in the natives, yet the loss of his fowling-piece was considered as a proper
         punishment for his imprudence. The afternoon was spent in different rambles on shore. My
         father, with a single sailor, walked over a considerable part of the island, without the
         least molestation from the inhabitants, and brought on board a number of new plants. No
         other complaints arose against the natives this day, except some petty thefts, at which
         they were expert like their brethren of Tonga-Tabboo and the Society Islands.</p>

      <p><date>[Tuesday 28.]</date>The next morning early we discovered several islands to the N. W.
         of us, which a haze in that quarter had hitherto screened from our sight. The two
         westermost were high, one peaked, but the other12 more extensive. A thick smoke arose from
         the last, on which, during the night, we had observed a fire. The natives who came on board
         acquainted us that this fire was constant, so that we concluded it to proceed from a
         volcano. They called this island Tofooa , and the peak close to it e-Ghao . To the
         northward of these two we discerned thirteen low islands, each of which the natives named
         to us.</p>

      <p>We hastened ashore after breakfast, to resume our enquiries. We soon left the beach, where
         the natives were again assembled in great numbers of both sexes. A most beautiful kind of
         lily (crinum asiaticum) was the first plant which we met with; and several others, not less
         valuable, were collected soon after. We came to the watering-place, which was a pond about
         a hundred or a hundred and fifty yards long, and fifty broad; it contained stagnant water,
         which was somewhat tainted with a brackish taste, and might perhaps have subterraneous
         communications with the salt lagoon, which in one place adjoined to it. Lieutenant Clerke,
         who superintended the waters, told us that his musket had been nimbly snatched away by one
         of the natives, who instantly ran off with it. We advanced to the salt lagoon, and
         botanized among the spacious mangroves which surrounded it. These trees occupy a vast space
         of ground, and grow more and more intricate by age. Their seeds do not drop off, but shoot
         down from the top of the tree, till they reach the ground, where they take root, and spread
         new branches. Whilst we were here, we heard three great guns fired; but the sound being
         broken by many intervening objects, we suspected that they were only muskets overcharged as
         usual, by some young gentlemen on a shooting party. We left the lake soon after, and passed
         through a plantation, where the natives bowed to us very kindly, and invited us to sit down
         amongst them. We were desirous of making the most of our time, and therefore soon left
         them, and returned to the fresh-water pond. Having fired a musket at some wild-ducks, which
         were in great plenty, we were called to by Mr. Gilbert, the master, who told us that a
         volley of small arms, and three cannon had been fired to alarm and bring us back, because a
         fray had happened between the natives and our people. We joined him in a few minutes, and
         found with him the captain, and a file of marines, together with two natives, who sat on
         their hams, and from time to time pronounced the word wòa, which signifies " friend" . We
         supposed that the theft of Mr. Clerke's musket had given occasion to this disturbance; but
         this was too trifling a circumstance to be resented. The cooper, in mending the water-cask,
         was not sufficiently attentive to his adze, and one of the natives had snatched it up, and
         conveyed it away. The captain, in order to recover this valuable instrument, of which
         however there were no less than a dozen in the ship, ordered his people to seize several
         large double canoes, which had probably arrived from different adjacent islands. They
         performed his command, and Mr. Clerke's gun was brought back by the astonished natives. But
         this was not sufficient, and another canoe was seized. A native, who stood upon it,
         defended his property, which he had forfeited by no offence, and took up a spear, which he
         seemed resolved to employ with good effect. Captain Cook levelled his musket at him, and
         bid him lay down his arms. He refused, and received a load of shot through his wrist and
         thigh, at the distance of eight or nine yards, which immediately brought him to the ground.
         The volley was now fired, and a boat sent off to the ship, where three canon, directed
         against the highest point of the island, were fired off one after another. It was thought
         that the natives would now have left us; but a great part still remained on the beach
         conscious of their innocence, and some canoes continued to ply about the ship. The
         behaviour of one of the natives upon this occasion was so remarkably stoical, that our
         people could not help taking notice of it. He had a small canoe in which he always met the
         other canoes before they reached the ship, took out what he liked, and paid their owners, a
         certain small price in European goods, which he had before obtained by barter. With his new
         cargo he returned to the ship, and always made a considerable profit upon his bargain. As
         he never failed to visit each canoe, our sailors called him a Custom-house officer. He was
         lying close to the ship, baling the water out of his canoe, when the guns were discharged
         not two yards over his head. Notwithstanding the extraordinary concussion at so short a
         distance, he never once looked up, but continued to bale, and afterwards to trade as if
         nothing had happened.</p>

      <p>We had not long rejoined the captain and his party, when the unlucky adze was brought back,
         which had been the occasion of so much mischief. A middle-aged woman, who seemed to have
         great authority, had dispatched some of the people after it, and they returned at the same
         time a cartridge-box, and Mr. Patton's fowling-piece, which appeared to have been concealed
         under water. The wounded man was brought to us on a piece of wood carried by men. He seemed
         almost without sensation; and was set on the ground, whilst the natives gradually returned,
         and began to take courage. The women in particular, were very desirous of restoring the
         general tranquility, and their timid looks seemed to charge the behaviour of the strangers
         with cruelty. They seated themselves on a fine green turf, in a group of fifty or more
         together, and invited several of us to sit by them. Each of them had some shaddocks, which
         they broke in pieces, and distributed to us with every mark of kindness and peace. Mr.
         Patton's friend was one of the foremost, and indeed claimed the first rank among the
         beauties of those islands. Her stature was graceful, and her form exquisitely proportioned.
         Her features were more regular than any I had ever seen in these isles, full of sweetness
         and the charms of youth. Her large dark eyes sparkled with fire, and her ebony curls
         floated on her neck. She was of a lighter colour than the common people, and wore a brown
         cloth which closely embracing the body immediately under the breast, but being somewhat
         wider towards the feet, perhaps suited her better than the most elegant European dress.</p>

      <p>Mr. Patton having been sent for, arrived with proper instruments, and dressed the wounds of
         the poor native, whose countrymen brought many banana leaves, which were laid on over the
         dressing. A bottle of brandy was given them, with directions to wash the wounds with the
         liquor from time to time. The wound was not dangerous, as it happened in a fleshy part; but
         as the distance was so short, the shot had torn the flesh very much, and made the wound
         very painful to the poor man. After this we distributed some beads, and departed making
         various signs of friendship. The natives like those of Tonga-Tabboo, were strangers to
         resentment, and continued to trade with our ship as before. They seemed to possess a truly
         mercantile spirit, and spared no trouble to obtain some of our goods or curiosities. Among
         the rest, they were much delighted with a great number of young puppies which we had taken
         on board at the Society Islands, on purpose to stock such islands as were not provided with
         them. We left two couple on Namoka, of which the natives promised to take particular care.
         These people managed their canoes with surprising agility, and swam with the greatest ease.
         Their common trading-canoes were neatly made, and polished like those which I have already
         described. But those of the neighbouring islands were of a great size, and some of them
         contained upwards of fifty people. They always consisted of two large canoes, fastened by a
         transverse platform of planks, in the midst of which they had erected a hut, where they
         placed their goods, their arms, and utensils, and where they passed a great part of their
         time. There were likewise holes, which gave admittance into the body of each canoe. Their
         masts were stout poles which could be struck at pleasure, and their sails were very large
         and triangular, but not very proper to sail by the wind. All their cordage was excellent,
         and they had also contrived a very good ground tackle, consisting of a strong rope with
         large stones at the end, by means of which they came to an anchor.</p>

      <p>We went on shore again after dinner, as captain Cook proposed leaving this island the next
         day. We passed through several fields and wild shrubberies, and collected a number of
         valuable plants. We also made a purchase of several arms, such as clubs, and spears, and of
         some utensils, viz. small stools, large wooden dishes and bowls, in which the people
         prepare their victuals, and some earthern pots which seemed to have been long in use. The
         great abundance of their arms, does not agree with their good-nature and hospitable
         disposition, unless they quarrel with their next neighbours, like the people of Taheitee
         and the Society Islands. But they seemed to have spent too much time in ornamenting their
         clubs, to have frequent occasion to use them.</p>

      <p>At day-break the next morning we unmoored and set sail, standing towards the island of
         Tofooa, on which we had again observed the volcano burning during night. A whole fleet of
         canoes followed us several miles, trading with a variety of articles, particularly their
         dresses, utensils, and ornaments. Some of them likewise brought fish of different sorts,
         which we had found very well-tasted.</p>

      <p>The island of Namoka, which we left after a stay of two days only, was not above fifteen
         miles in circuit, but seemed to be remarkably populous. It lies in 20° 17' S.14 and 174°
         32' W. In the group of islands which appeared around it, its size was the most
         considerable; but all seemed to be well inhabited, and very rich in vegetable productions.
         They are situated on a kind of bank, on which there is from nine to sixty and seventy
         fathom water, and the soil is probably the same in every island. Namoka consists, like
         Tonga-Tabboo, of a coral-rock, covered with a rich mould on which all sorts of vegetables
         thrive. We had no time to examine the hillock in its centre, which seems to have had a
         different origin, and may perhaps be volcanic. At present it is wholly covered with the
         richest groves, like the rest of the island. The abundance of fresh water in the pond, is
         an advantage which the people of Namoka enjoy in preference to those of Tonga-Tabboo; but
         it does not appear that they bathe so regularly as the Taheitians, perhaps because the
         stagnant water is not very inviting. Its advantage is however so much felt, that the
         natives brought it to the ship in calabashes, and did the same to Tasman, which implies
         that it is looked upon as a valuable article among them. The abundance of water, and the
         richness of the soil likewise seems to be the reason, that bread-fruit and shaddock trees
         are much more frequent, and all vegetation infinitely more luxuriant than on Tonga-Tabboo.
         The fences on that account are not laid out, and kept up with that extreme regularity,
         though they are still preserved in part. The long walks of fruit-trees, and the delightful
         green turf under them, were rather to be compared to the richest spots on Ea-oowhe, or
         Middleburg Island. The tufted arbours which vaulted over the paths, are hung with beautiful
         flowers of all kinds, many of which filled the air with fragrance. The variety of scenes
         formed by many little risings, and different groups of houses and trees, together with the
         lagoons, conspire to adorn this island. The fowls and hogs which we saw in the
         neighbourhood of every dwelling, the prodigious number of shaddocks which lay under every
         tree, hardly noticed by the natives, and the quantities of yams which filled their houses,
         gave a picture of abundance and affluence which delighted the eye and comforted the heart.
         At sight of a plenteous prospect, human nature feels an instinctive satisfaction, and good
         humour and joy are soon revived in the most dejected breast. Amidst the dismal scenes of
         our voyage, these intervening moments are remarkably contrasted, and therefore had a great
         effect upon us. It is so natural to dwell upon pleasing subjects, that I hope, I need not
         apologize for my frequent descriptions; and I must refer the reader to Mr. Hodges's view in
         the interior parts of Namoka </p>

      <p> The natives, who were happy enough to call these fertile groves their own, did not appear
         to me to differ in any respect from those of Tonga-Tabboo, and Ea-oowhe. Their stature was
         middle-sized, their colour a bright chestnut brown, and their whole body well-proportioned,
         without being corpulent. Their punctures, their dress, the customs of clipping the beard,
         and powdering the hair, their arms, utensils, and canoes, their language and manners were
         exactly such as we had noticed at Tonga-Tabboo. But in the short time which we staid on
         their island, we could not observe any subordination among them, though this had strongly
         characterised the natives of Tonga-Tabboo, who seemed to descend even to servility in their
         obeisance to their king. At Namoka we could not distinguish any persons of superior rank or
         authority, unless we except the man, whom our sailors called a Custom-house officer, and
         who inspected all the canoes which came to the ship.16 The woman who sent for the stolen
         things, appeared also to have some sway among them; and since there is reason to suppose,
         that women whose hair is allowed to grow long, have some prerogatives above the rest in the
         South Sea , Mr. Patton's friendly benefactress seems to have been a lady of a superior
         class, which her whole deportment confirmed. She was the only woman with long hair whom we
         saw on the island. I am far from concluding that the people of Namoka have no fixed
         government; on the contrary, their vicinity and similarity to other islanders, amongst whom
         a monarchical government takes place, and the example of all the other islanders of the
         South Sea which former navigators have examined, give the greatest room to suppose the same
         existing there. The general coincidence of their manners with those of Tonga-Tabboo,
         strongly prove that they have the same origin, and probably the same religious notions; but
         notwithstanding this agreement, I never found a fayetooka or burying-place, during my
         rambles upon Namoka, nor did any one of our shipmates meet with a place in any wise
         resembling the burying-place which we found at Tonga-Tabboo.</p>

      <p> It appears, from the accounts of former voyagers, that between the meridians of 170° east
         from Greenwich, and 180°, there is a great number of islands, from the 10th to the 22d
         degree of latitude; all which, as far as they are known, seem to be inhabited by one race
         of people, who speak the same dialect of the South Sea tongue, and have the same social and
         mercantile disposition. All these then might be added to the Friendly Islands. They are in
         general remarkably well inhabited, particularly those which we visited. Tonga-Tabboo is
         almost one continual garden, and Ea-oowe, Namoka, and the adjacent islands, are some of the
         most fertile spots in the Pacific Ocean. We shall therefore be extremely moderate in our
         calculation, if we suppose the number of inhabitants in all these islands does not exceed
         200,000 persons.17 Their healthy climate, and its excellent productions, keep them free
         from those numerous diseases, to which we fall an easy prey, and, according to their plain
         and simple notions, satisfy all their wants. Their progress in the arts, beyond other
         nations in the South Sea, and particularly their refinement in music, serve to pass away
         their time agreeably, and give them taste to acknowledge and discern the beauties of their
         own exquisite forms, from whence one of the strongest ties of society is derived. Their
         general turn is active and industrious, but their behaviour to strangers more polite than
         cordial. Their peculiar propensity to trade seems to have substituted this insincere
         civility, in the room of real friendship, from those interested and mercenary principles
         which commerce inspires. Both these characters are in direct opposition to those of the
         Taheitians, who delight in an indolent life, and are too hearty in their affections to
         confine them to outward shew and specious appearances. However there are many luxurious
         individuals (arreoys) at the Society Islands, whose moral character appears to be somewhat
         depraved; whilst the people of the Friendly Islands seem to be ignorant of vices, which can
         only have arisen from a superior degree of opulence.</p>

      <p>The canoes which accompanied us from Namoka returned at noon to several low islands, all
         which seemed to be well inhabited and fertile, like so many beautiful gardens. After dinner
         the wind became contrary, and abated, so that we rather lost than gained ground. A few
         canoes came up with us again, for the natives spared no labour to obtain our nails and rags
         of cloth. Towards evening we were surrounded by a little fleet, and the trade was very
         brisk, chiefly for the utensils and arms of the islanders, which are made with remarkable
         neatness.</p>

      <p><date>[Thursday 30.]</date>The canoes returned once more to us the next morning, putting
         off at day-break from all the little islands in sight. Their appearance and their sailing
         afforded us much entertainment. Before the wind they go extremely swift, being well
         contrived for that purpose, and their broad triangular sail gives them a very picturesque
         form at a distance. We left them in a short time, when the breeze freshened, and sailed
         towards the two high islands, which we had discovered whilst we lay at anchor. In the
         afternoon three canoes came up with us again; and one of them, with 50 men on board, traded
         with us just as we were in the narrow passage between both islands. The larger, to the
         southward, which is called Tofoòa, appeared to be inhabited. Some of the natives on board
         our ship told us it had fresh water, together with coco-nut, banana, and bread-fruit trees.
         We saw indeed a number of palms, and a great quantity of the club-wood.18 The whole island,
         though steep, was in some places covered with verdure or shrubbery. Towards the sea, and
         especially towards the other island, the rocks seemed burnt, and black sand covered the
         shore. We approached within a cable's length of it, but found a depth of eighty fathom,
         which prevented our coming to an anchor. The rocks towards the passage, which was not above
         a mile across, were cavernous, and in some places had a rude columnar shape. The day was
         somewhat hazy, and the top of the island was therefore covered with clouds. The smoke
         however rolled up with impetuosity, and seemed, before we had passed the strait, to issue
         from the other side of the mountain. As soon as we had passed it, it appeared to arise from
         the side which we had just left. This deception proves, that the top of the mountain was
         hollow, or formed a crater, from whence the vapour was thrown up. There was a spot on the
         N. W. side of the island, somewhat below the place where we saw the smoke come out, which
         had the appearance of being lately burnt: it was destitute of verdure, though the mountain
         on both sides of it was covered with various plants. When we came exactly into the line in
         which the smoke was carried by the wind, we had a small shower of rain, and many of us felt
         it very biting and sharp, when it dropped into our eyes. It is probable from thence, that
         it carried down with it some particles which the volcano had ejected. The wind being at S.
         S. E. and freshening, we left this island, without being able to make any farther
         observations upon it; though it well deserved the attention of the learned, who make the
         revolutions which our globe has undergone, the object of their useful and curious
         enquiries.</p>

      <p><date>[1774. July.][Friday 1.]</date>We sailed to the W. S. W. and continued the same
         course all the next day. The following day, very near noon, we discovered land, which, from
         the direction of our track, had never been seen by other navigators. We ran toward it, and
         before night approached pretty near it; but found breakers before us, which obliged us to
         tack all night, for fear of an accident. Several lights which appeared on shore as soon as
         it was dark, announced to us that the island was inhabited.</p>

      <p><date>[Sunday 3.]</date>The next morning we bore down upon it again, and came round its
         east end. It appeared to be about seven miles long,19 and had two small hills of very
         gentle ascent, wholly covered with woods, like the rest of the island. One end sloped into
         a flat point, on which we observed fine groves of coco-palms, and fruit-trees,20 together
         with houses in their shade. A fine sandy beach surrounded the shore, and at the distance of
         half a mile, a coral reef encompassed the east side of the island, which at the points
         projected near two miles from the shore. On this reef we soon perceived five blackish-brown
         men, with clubs in their hands, looking at us very attentively. We hoisted a boat out, and
         sent the master to sound an opening between the reefs which we saw before us. He went on
         through the entrance towards the shore, where we observed upwards of thirty inhabitants
         sitting. Amongst them ten or twelve were armed with spears; but as soon as our boat came
         near, they hauled a canoe into the woods, which had brought their five men to and from the
         reef, and all ran off when the master landed. He laid some nails, a knife, and a few medals
         on the sandy beach, and returned on board, to acquaint the captain that there was no bottom
         in the entrance of the reef, and not sufficient depth within it. He had observed a dozen or
         more large turtles swimming in the harbour; but being destitute of harpoons, or other
         instruments, could not strike any of them. Our boat was hoisted in again, and the hopes of
         botanizing on this island were entirely frustrated. We continued standing along its reef,
         on which we observed some large single rocks of coral, near fifteen feet above the surface
         of the water, narrow at the base, and spreading out at the top. Whether an earthquake had
         raised them so high out of the sea, in which they must have been formed, or whether some
         other cause ought to be assigned for this curious fact, remains to be determined.</p>

      <p>A few miles to the westward of the island we found a great circular reef of coral,
         including a lagoon. It was suspected that this lagoon might be the abode of turtles, and
         two boats were hoisted out in the afternoon to go in quest of them. The fishery proved very
         unsuccessful, not a single turtle being seen, and the crew hoisted the boats in again
         before sunset. We then left this new discovery, which was named Turtle Island, and is
         situated in 19° 48' S. and 178° 2' W.</p>

      <p>We ran to the W. S. W. with a fresh trade-wind by day, but tacked every night. No birds
         attended us on this course, except now and then a white booby, or a man of war bird. The
         fair weather, the yams of Namoka, and the hope of making new discoveries in this part of
         the Pacific Ocean, which had never been visited before, kept us all in very good
         spirits.</p>

      <p><date>[Saturday 9.]</date>On the 9th of July, having reached nearly 176° E. and being in
         20° S. we changed our course to the N. W. Our fresh gale continued without any change till
         the 13th, <date>[Wednesd. 13.]</date>when it was somewhat abated, and a few drops of rain
         fell both at night and in the morning. The second anniversary of our departure from
         England, which happened on this day, was celebrated by the sailors with their usual mirth.
         They drank plentifully, having saved a part of their daily allowance, for this solemn
         occasion, and drowned every gloomy idea in grog, the mariner's Lethe. One of them, of a
         fanatical22 turn, composed a hymn on the occasion, as he had done the first year; and after
         seriously exhorting his fellows to repentance, sat down and hugged the bottle heartily; but
         like all the rest, he proved unequal to the conflict, and sunk under the powerful influence
         of his adversary.</p>

      <p>The wind freshened very much the two following days, and on the third the weather became
         hazy, with showers of rain. A calabash, which we observed drifting past the ship, seemed to
         indicate the near approach of land; and indeed a few hours after, about two o'clock in the
         afternoon, on the <date>[Saturday 16.]</date>16th, we made it out at a little distance
         before us, being high, and of considerable extent. The gale encreased towards night, and
         the ship rolled very much; the rains were incessant at the same time, and coming through
         the decks into our cabins, thoroughly soaked our books, cloaths, and beds, depriving us of
         rest. The same heavy gales, with bad weather, continued all the next day, and so involved
         the land in clouds, that we could scarce discern it, but were forced to stand off and on.
         This weather was the more disagreeable, as it was unexpected in a sea, which has always
         been termed Pacific. It proves, that no entire reliance may be had upon general
         denominations; and, that though storms and hurricanes are perhaps very seldom felt in this
         ocean, yet it is not wholly free from them. Its western part is particularly known for
         strong gales. When captain Pedro Fernandez de Quiros left his Tierra del Espiritù Santo;
         when M. de Bougainville was on the coast of the Louisiade; and when captain Cook, in the
         Endeavour, explored the eastern coast of New Holland, each of them met with stormy weather.
         Perhaps it may be owing to the large lands which are situated in this part of the ocean; at
         least it is known, that the stated winds of the torrid zone become variable in the
         neighbourhood of high and extensive coasts.</p>

      <p>The weather was a little clearer the next morning, so that we could venture to run in
         shore. We distinguished two islands, which were the Whitsun and Aurora Islandsof M. de
         Bougainville, and ran for the northern extremity of the latter.</p>

      <p><date>[Monday 18.]</date>Thus, after spending two years in visiting the discoveries of
         former voyagers, in rectifying their mistakes, and in combating vulgar errors, we began the
         third, by investigating a group of islands which the French navigator, pressed by
         necessity, and ill fitted out, had left with precipitation. It was reserved for this last
         year to teem in new discoveries, and to make amends for the two first. We had, it is true,
         no reason to complain, since most of the countries we had visited, were scarcely known to
         the world, from the vague and unphilosophical accounts of the discoverers. We had room to
         make a variety of observations on men and manners, which, though they ought to be the first
         objects of travellers, have still been postponed, even by those who have aimed at being
         looked upon by the world as the most enlightened. But, as mankind are ever captivated by
         the charms of novelty, the history of our transactions, during the ensuing months, will
         have that advantage at least to recommend it to their attention.</p>
