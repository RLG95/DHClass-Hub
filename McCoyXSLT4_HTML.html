      <h1></h1>
      
      <p>At the turning of the Fourth Age, in the year 3E 433, the <span class="characterName">Emperor Uriel Septim VII</span> was
         assassinated and the Amulet of Kings
         was destroyed. This set in motion a chain of events that would bring
         down an empire and change forever the relationship between man and the gods.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The assassins first attacked the
         <span class="characterName">Emperor</span> in the
         White Gold Tower. While the Blades held them back,
         the <span class="characterName">Emperor</span> made <span class="characterName">his</span> way down to the
         dungeons, to a secret escape
         route built into one of the prison cells. For
         reasons known only to <span class="characterName">himself</span>, the <span class="characterName">Emperor</span>
         pardoned the fortunate <span class="characterName">prisoner</span> in that cell. Some say the
         <span class="characterName">prisoner</span> reminded <span class="characterName">him</span> of a childhood friend. Others say it was a moment of
         prophecy. Whatever the case, the <span class="characterName">prisoner</span> came to play a fateful role in the history of the
         Empire and Tamriel - surely a sign that
         the gods themselves were at work.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The pursuing assassins killed the
         Blades bodyguards in a relentless
         series of sneak attacks. Eventually they
         struck down the <span class="characterName">Emperor</span>
         <span class="characterName">himself</span>. Before <span class="characterName">he</span> fell, <span class="characterName">Uriel Septim VII</span> gave the Amulet of Kings to
         the <span class="characterName">prisoner</span>, who somehow
         made it out of the Imperial sewers and
         into the light of day.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The assassination is now known to have been the work of a group of daedric cultists known as the Mythic Dawn. (Those who still suspect the Dark Brotherhood should consider two facts: first, they would have only
         needed a single assassin, not a small army of them; second, the Dark Brotherhood would never be so foolish as to
         effectively declare war on the Empire and thus ensure their
         complete destruction. Witness the eventual fate of the Mythic
         Dawn.)
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>The Amulet of Kings next surfaced at Weynon
         Priory near Chorrol. <span class="characterName">Jauffre</span>, secret Grandmaster of the
         Blades and head of the
         priory, took possession of the
         amulet. The <span class="characterName">messenger</span> was sent off to Kvatch to find a lowly <span class="characterName">priest</span> named <span class="characterName">Martin</span>.
         Unbeknownst even to <span class="characterName">himself</span>, <span class="characterName">Martin</span> was the bastard son of <span class="characterName">Uriel Septim VII</span>, and the last heir to the Ruby
         Throne. <span class="characterName">He</span> alone could use the
         Amulet of Kings to light the Dragonfires that wards the
         barrier between Tamriel and Oblivion, and save
         the world from the Mythic Dawn plot.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The <span class="characterName">prisoner</span> arrived at Kvatch to find it overrun by daedra that had poured in
         from a newly-opened Oblivion Gate, the start of the Empire-spanning devastation of
         the
         Oblivion Crisis. How the <span class="characterName">prisoner</span> closed
         the gate is not recorded. Once closed, <span class="characterName">Martin</span> and the surviving Kvatch
         guardsmen drove back the daedra.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Now known as the Hero of Kvatch, the <span class="characterName">prisoner</span> and <span class="characterName">Martin</span>
         returned to Weynon Priory, only to find the
         priory sacked and the Amulet taken.
         <span class="characterName">Jauffre</span> survived the attack, however, and
         the <span class="characterName">three of them</span>
         made their way to Cloud Ruler Temple, bastion of
         the Blades. This secret fortress in
         the mountains outside Bruma is
         where <span class="characterName">Martin</span> was held safe while
         the Hero of Kvatch searched for the lost
         Amulet.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Knowing only that a mysterious group called the Mythic
         Dawn was behind the assassination and theft of the
         Amulet, the Hero of Kvatch was sent to locate
         the cult. With the help of
         <span class="characterName">Baurus</span>, a Blade in the
         service of the <span class="characterName">Emperor</span>, <span class="characterName">they</span> somehow used the
         Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes,
         esoteric works by the madman <span class="characterName">Mankar Camoran</span>,
         to direct <span class="characterName">them</span> to the Mythic Dawn's secret lair. Scholars
         familiar with the Commentaries claim the location is not directly
         mentioned in them. How <span class="characterName">they</span> did this remains a mystery.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>No official records exist of how the Hero of
         Kvatch penetrated the Mythic Dawn's lair
         near Lake Arrius. There is a bardic tale that claims the <span class="characterName">Hero</span> used trickery and disguise, but
         that is just speculation.What was discovered there is that <span class="characterName">Mankar Camoran</span> was behind the Mythic Dawn, and that the group worshiped the daedric prince <span class="characterName">Mehrunes Dagon</span>. <span class="characterName">Mankar
            Camoran</span> believed <span class="characterName">himself</span> to
         be a direct descendant of the <span class="characterName">Camoran Usurper</span>, the infamous
         pretender to the throne of Valenwood.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Somehow the <span class="characterName">Hero</span> escaped with the
         Mysterium Xarxes itself, the holy book of
         the Mythic Dawn cult. <span class="characterName">Mankar Camoran</span> fled to Oblivion with the
         Amulet of Kings. With some effort and great risk to
         <span class="characterName">his</span> sanity, <span class="characterName">Martin</span> deciphered the Mysterium
         Xarxes and intended to use it to open a gateway
         to <span class="characterName">Mankar Camoran</span> in order to recover the
         Amulet of Kings.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Before <span class="characterName">Martin</span> could perform the ritual
         to open the gateway, <span class="characterName">Mehrunes
            Dagon</span> opened an Oblivion Gate outside Bruma. The Hero of
         Kvatch saved the city and <span class="characterName">Martin</span>
         by entering the gate and closing it before a daedric siege engine could destroy Bruma
         and Cloud Ruler Temple. Many songs and stories have been told of
         this battle and I will not retell them here. The Hero of Kvatch was now also known as the Savior of Bruma.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>With the city and Cloud Ruler
         Temple safe, <span class="characterName">Martin</span>
         opened the portal to <span class="characterName">Mankar Camoran</span>'s
         "Paradise". The details of what transpired in
         this place have not been recorded. All that is known is that
         the Savior of Bruma travelled to this Paradise,
         killed <span class="characterName">Mankar Camoran</span>, and returned with
         the Amulet of Kings.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>With the Amulet in hand, <span class="characterName">Martin Septim</span> presented <span class="characterName">himself</span> to the Elder
         Council to be crowned Emperor of all
         Tamriel. Once crowned <span class="characterName">he</span> planned to relight the Dragonfires and seal
         Tamriel from Oblivion. In a last-ditch
         attempt to stop <span class="characterName">him</span>, <span class="characterName">Mehrunes Dagon</span> launched an assault on the
         Imperial City, opening several Oblivion Gates
         within the capital itself. Uncrowned,
         <span class="characterName">Martin</span> joined the battle in the city streets.
      </p>
      
      
      <p><span class="characterName">Mehrunes Dagon himself</span>
         left Oblivion and entered
         Tamriel, breaking the covenant. Only the unlit
         Dragonfires allowed this to be possible. Now that the barrier was ripped asunder,
         it was
         too late to relighting the Fires. <span class="characterName">Martin
            Septim</span> chose to make the ultimate sacrifice - <span class="characterName">he</span> shattered the Amulet of
         Kings to become the <span class="characterName">avatar of the god
            Akatosh</span> and do battle with <span class="characterName">Mehrunes
               Dagon</span>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Records of this battle vary wildly. What we do know is that
         <span class="characterName">Mehrunes Dagon</span> was
         defeated and sent back to Oblivion.
         The <span class="characterName">avatar of Akatosh</span> was
         turned to stone and can be seen to this day in the Temple of
         the One in the Imperial City. With the
         Amulet gone, the Dragonfires quenched, and the last
         Dragonblood Emperor dead, the barrier to Oblivion is sealed
         forever.
